faq_general,"Definisi Hipnoterapi","Apa itu hipnoterapi?","Hipnoterapi adalah metode terapi yang menggunakan kondisi hipnosis (trance) untuk mengakses pikiran bawah sadar dan melakukan perubahan positif. Dalam kondisi trance, klien tetap sadar penuh tapi sangat rileks dan fokus, sehingga lebih mudah menerima sugesti terapeutik. Hipnoterapi efektif untuk mengatasi berbagai masalah psikologis, kebiasaan buruk, fobia, trauma, dan gangguan psikosomatis. Success rate mencapai 75-90% untuk berbagai kondisi. Sesi berlangsung 60-90 menit dengan pendekatan yang disesuaikan kebutuhan individu.","hipnoterapi,definisi,terapi hipnosis,hipnotis",10
faq_general,"Keamanan","Apakah hipnoterapi aman?","Ya, hipnoterapi sangat aman bila dilakukan oleh terapis terlatih dan bersertifikat.

Selama 200+ tahun penggunaan klinis, tidak ada kasus efek samping permanen yang terdokumentasi. WHO dan American Psychological Association mengakui hipnoterapi sebagai modalitas terapi yang aman dan efektif.","keamanan,aman,risiko,bahaya,safety",10
faq_general,"Kehilangan Kontrol","Apakah saya akan kehilangan kontrol saat dihipnosis?","Tidak, ini adalah mitos terbesar tentang hipnosis. Anda TIDAK akan kehilangan kontrol sama sekali. Hipnosis justru adalah kondisi fokus tinggi dimana Anda tetap sadar dan bisa mendengar semua yang dikatakan terapis. Anda bisa menolak sugesti yang tidak sesuai dengan nilai Anda, dan bisa keluar dari kondisi hipnosis kapan saja. Bahkan dalam kondisi trance paling dalam sekalipun, bagian conscious mind Anda tetap berfungsi sebagai 'pengawas'. Anda tidak akan melakukan atau mengatakan hal yang bertentangan dengan moral atau keyakinan Anda.","kontrol,kehilangan kontrol,terkendali,sadar",10
