Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that is characterized by intense, recurrent, and unexpected panic attacks. Fear and anxiety can be normal reactions to specific situations and stressful events. Panic disorder differs from this normal fear and anxiety because it is often extreme, and may seem to strike out of the blue. A person with panic disorder may experience symptoms such as severe feelings of terror, rapid breathing, and rapid heart rate. People with panic disorder may experience these attacks unexpectedly and for no apparent reason, but they can also be preceded by some sort of triggering event or situation. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) reports that approximately 2.7% of the adult U.S. population experiences panic disorder each year. Approximately 44.8% of these individuals experience cases of panic disorder that are classified as \"severe.\" According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of American, nearly six million American adults experience the symptoms of panic disorder during any given year.﻿﻿ While panic disorder can strike at any point in life, symptoms most often begin during late adolescence or early adulthood and affect twice as many women as men. Many people living with panic disorder describe feeling as though they are having a heart attack or on the verge of dying, and experience some or all of the following symptoms:﻿﻿ Panic disorder can lead to serious disruptions in daily functioning and make it difficult to cope with normal, everyday situations that may trigger feelings of intense panic and anxiety. To be diagnosed with a panic disorder, a person must experience recurrent and often unexpected panic attacks, according to the DSM-5. In addition, at least one attack needs to be followed by one month or more of the person fearing that they'll have more attacks. Your healthcare provider will also need to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, including: Because panic disorder often leads to a person avoiding certain situations or objects, it can also lead to the development of phobias. For example, a person living with panic disorder might stop leaving home in order to prevent having an attack or losing control in public. In time, this person might develop agoraphobia, a marked fear of being in a variety of situations outside of the home in which escape might be difficult or help might not be available if debilitating symptoms develop. While previous versions of the DSM categorized panic disorder as occurring with or without agoraphobia, the newest edition of the diagnostic manual lists the two as distinct and separate disorders. Although the exact causes of panic disorder are not clearly understood, many mental health experts believe that a combination of environmental, biological, and psychological factors play a role: There are two main types of panic attacks: unexpected and expected. People with panic disorder most commonly experience unexpected panic attacks, but some do experience both types. Panic disorder, like other anxiety disorders, is often treated with psychotherapy, medication (antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs), or a combination of both. Psychotherapy for panic disorder can include several different approaches, including: Medications for panic disorder fall into one of two categories: antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs.﻿﻿ Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants used for panic disorder, including: Benzodiazepines are a commonly prescribed class of anti-anxiety medication that can help reduce the severity of panic attacks acutely, including: In addition to medication and psy...",
  "summary": "Disorder kecemasan panik (panic disorder) adalah gangguan kecemasan yang ditandai dengan serangan panik tajam, berulang, dan tidak terduga. Serangan ini mencakup perasaan ketakutan ekstrem, napas cepat, detak jantung cepat, dan perasaan seperti mengalami serangan jantung atau hampir mati. Perbedaan utama antara kecemasan panik dan reaksi kecemasan normal terletak pada intensitas dan kejutan serangan yang muncul tanpa alasan jelas. Banyak penderita merasa terancam, terutama saat serangan terjadi secara tiba-tiba. Menurut National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), sekitar 2,7% populasi dewasa di AS mengalami gangguan ini setiap tahun, dengan 44,8% kasus dikategorikan sebagai parah. Sekitar enam juta orang dewasa di AS mengalami gejala kecemasan panik setiap tahun. Gejala ini paling sering muncul pada masa remaja akhir hingga awal dewasa, dan memengaruhi dua kali lebih banyak perempuan dibandingkan pria. Kondisi ini dapat mengganggu fungsi sehari-hari dan membuat seseorang sulit menghadapi kehidupan sehari-hari. Diagnosis kecemasan panik berdasarkan kriteria DSM-5, yang memerlukan serangan panik berulang dan tidak terduga. Perawatan meliputi terapi kognitif perilaku (CBT), terapi meditasi, dan, dalam kasus berat, obat seperti antidepresan. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, konsep tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) dan pengendalian emosi melalui ibadah dan refleksi dapat menjadi pendekatan spiritual yang mendukung pemulihan. Dengan mengatur pikiran, memperkuat kepercayaan diri, dan memperbaiki keseimbangan emosional, penderita dapat mengatasi kecemasan dan membangun ketahanan mental yang lebih kuat.",
