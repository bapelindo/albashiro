  "content": "This book spells out exactly what happens within the personality when psychotherapy is successful. Much of the answer has long been written between the lines of Freud’s seminal works, awaiting their coming together and integration. The book considers what changes within various psychic systems and how these are functions of the underlying disorders are spelled out for neurotic, borderline and psychotic illnesses. The result is the identification of another vein of ore in Freud’s ideas that clarifies the healing aspects of his model, and adds a new level of precision to the therapeutic process. Freud’s writings on the nature of healing and growth take second place to his ideas on the structure of the personality and pathology. His well-defined ideas on the mechanism of healing and growth are scattered across his writings and rarely, if ever, drawn together into a unified presentation. His following has deeply explored the meanings of his seminal ideas when it comes to theory and practice, but is short in the area of what actually takes place within successful psychotherapy. This text’s effort to gather up and unify his thoughts in this area results in both theoretical and therapeutic gains, the former for clarifications of how various psychic systems function within healing and growth, and the latter because of a more exact identification of the signs of it. Anthony F. Badalamenti is a research scientist in psychiatry. He has worked in quantifying psychiatric research, especially psychoanalysis, at the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research, Columbia University Psychiatric Institute, and the University of New England Department of Psychology. He consults as a mathematician in psychiatric and medical research, and has published over 60 papers in these areas. He has presented at NYU Langone Bellevue, the Nathan Kline Institute, and Albany Medical College, among others. While virologists predict the next pandemic, little attention has been paid to the psychological factors that influence the spread of infection, emotional distress, and social disruption. This book is the first comprehensive analysis of the psychology of pandemics. The Story Cookbook is a comprehensive collection of over 80 story-based activities. This easy-to-follow guide provides a treasure trove of techniques to apply and adapt. It is a must-read for consultants, educators, and leaders using storytelling for positive change. This book explores the human psyche (‘soul’) and its usefulness in a techno-scientific revolution that is often blind to its subject: the human being. It makes a strong intellectual case for the soul by examining consciousness, synchronicity, suffering, and death. Fractal dynamics provide a tool for understanding complexity. This book brings experts together to reconcile dichotomies like mind-brain and subjective-objective, bringing subjective experience into a scientific framework. What can we do about children who withdraw from loving care, or parents lost in the hurts of their own childhood? This book gathers 25 stories from 41 years in infant mental health, revealing how our earliest attachment experiences support or confound our later development. Synthesizing decades of research, this book explores innovations in teaching to enrich the lives of children. It offers practical strategies for educators and parents based on whole child development, creativity, and the power of play. Essential reading. This essential guide to the youth transgender crisis argues social contagion is a key factor in the upsurge. It exposes the perils of medicalization—from puberty blockers to hormones—and offers a vital psychotherapeutic path for families. This book offers Awareness Integration Therapy (AIT), a multi-modality approach synthesizing cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and body-mind theories. AIT is a must-read for clinicians and coaches who desire to offer deep therapeutic work in a brief period of time. This gui...",
  "summary": "Buku ini mengungkapkan proses yang terjadi dalam psikologi pribadi saat terapi psikologis berhasil. Meskipun banyak ide dari Freud tentang penyembuhan dan pertumbuhan telah ada dalam karyanya, mereka belum pernah dikumpulkan dan diintegrasikan secara sistematis. Buku ini menggabungkan dan memperjelas gagasan Freud mengenai perubahan dalam sistem psikis, terutama dalam gangguan neurotik, batas, dan psikotik. Dengan memperlihatkan bagaimana sistem psikis berfungsi dalam proses penyembuhan dan pertumbuhan, buku ini memberikan pemahaman baru tentang mekanisme terapi. Karya ini menekankan bahwa ide-ide Freud tentang struktur kepribadian dan patologi lebih dikenal, namun gagasan tentang proses penyembuhan dan pertumbuhan masih terpisah dan tidak terpadu. Penulis, Anthony F. Badalamenti, seorang ilmuwan peneliti di bidang psikiatri, telah mengkaji secara kuantitatif teori psianalisis dan mempublikasikan lebih dari 60 artikel. Ia juga pernah berbicara di berbagai institusi seperti NYU Langone, Nathan Kline Institute, dan Albany Medical College. Buku ini memberikan kontribusi teoritis dan praktis, dengan memperjelas tanda-tanda keberhasilan terapi. Dengan mengintegrasikan gagasan-gagasan Freud, buku ini membuka wawasan baru dalam memahami bagaimana penyembuhan dan pertumbuhan terjadi secara psikologis, serta memberikan panduan lebih akurat bagi praktisi terapi.",
