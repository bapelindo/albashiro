  "content": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on modifying dysfunctional emotions, behaviors, and thoughts by interrogating and uprooting negative or irrational beliefs. Considered a \"solutions-oriented\" form of talk therapy, CBT rests on the idea that thoughts and perceptions influence behavior. Feeling distressed, in some cases, may distort one’s perception of reality. CBT aims to identify harmful thoughts, assess whether they are an accurate depiction of reality, and, if they are not, employ strategies to challenge and overcome them. CBT is appropriate for people of all ages, including children, adolescents, and adults. Evidence has mounted that CBT can address numerous conditions, such as major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and many others. CBT is a preferred modality of therapy among practitioners and insurance companies alike as it can be effective in a brief period of time, generally 5 to 20 sessions, though there is no set time frame. Research indicates that CBT can be delivered effectively online, in addition to face-to-face therapy sessions. CBT focuses on present circumstances and emotions in real time, as opposed to childhood events. A clinician who practices CBT will likely ask about family history to get a better sense of the entire person, but will not spend inordinate time on past events. The emphasis is on what a person is telling themselves that might result in anxiety or disturbance. A person is then encouraged to address rational concerns practically, and to challenge irrational beliefs, rumination or catastrophizing. For example, a person who is upset about being single will be encouraged to take concrete measures but also question any undue negativity or unwarranted premise (\"I will be alone forever\") that they attach to this present-day fact. For more on psychotherapy in practice, visit the Therapy Center. A typical course of CBT is around 5 to 20 weekly sessions of about 45 minutes each. Treatment may continue for additional sessions that are spaced further apart, while the person keeps practicing skills on their own. The full course of treatment may last from 3 to 6 months, and longer in some cases if needed. In therapy, patients will learn to identify and challenge harmful thoughts, and replace them with a more realistic, healthy perspective. Patients may receive assignments between sessions, such as exercises to observe and recognize their thought patterns, and apply the skills they learn to real situations in their life. CBT programs tend to be structured and systematic, which makes it more likely that a person gets an adequate “dose” of healthy thinking and behaviors. For example, a patient with depression may be asked to write down the thoughts he has when something upsetting happens, and then to work with the therapist to test how helpful and accurate the thoughts are. Repeated and focused practice is an integral part of CBT. CBT centers around building new habits—which we may know but need to remember and implement successfully. Additionally, CBT programs can be standardized and tested so that the mental health field can identify which programs are effective, how long they take, and the benefits that patients can expect. Research has found the CBT delivered virtually is often equally as effective, and sometimes more effective, than CBT delivered in person. For example, one review study found that online CBT reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression to the same extent or more than in person CBT. Online CBT was also effective in treating post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobia. Given that online therapy removes certain barriers, such as travel time or childcare, it’s a strong option to consider. Almost everyone deals with distracting or destructive thoughts at times, but cognitive and behavioral principles can help you overcome ...",
  "summary": "Terapi Kognitif Berbasis Perilaku (CBT) adalah bentuk terapi psikologis yang bertujuan memodifikasi pikiran, perasaan, dan perilaku yang tidak sehat dengan mengidentifikasi dan mengganti keyakinan negatif atau tidak masuk akal. CBT berpendapat bahwa pikiran dan persepsi memengaruhi perilaku, dan perasaan cemas sering kali disebabkan oleh distorsi terhadap kenyataan. Terapi ini berfokus pada kondisi saat ini dan perasaan sekarang, bukan pada peristiwa masa lalu. Dalam CBT, individu diajak untuk mengenali pikiran negatif, mengevaluasi keakuratan mereka terhadap kenyataan, dan menggantinya dengan pikiran yang lebih rasional. CBT efektif untuk berbagai gangguan seperti depresi, kecemasan, PTSD, gangguan makan, dan gangguan obsesif. Terapi ini dapat dilakukan secara langsung maupun secara daring, dan biasanya membutuhkan 5 hingga 20 sesi, meskipun durasi bisa bervariasi. CBT dianggap sebagai pendekatan terapi yang efisien dan solutif karena hasilnya cepat dan terukur. Dalam praktiknya, terapis akan menanyakan tentang riwayat keluarga untuk memahami konteks keseluruhan, tetapi tidak terlalu fokus pada masa lalu. Individu diajak untuk mengambil tindakan konkret dan menantang keyakinan tidak masuk akal, seperti kecemasan akan kehilangan kekasaran atau kecemasan akan hidup sendiri selamanya. CBT sangat cocok untuk semua usia, termasuk anak-anak dan remaja. Dengan menekankan pada perbaikan pikiran dan perilaku sekarang, CBT membantu individu mengatasi gangguan emosional secara efektif dan berkelanjutan.",
