  "content": "This is a true second edition, so much so that it approaches being a different book. It includes among its new authors some of the most sought-after theorists in contemporary gestalt therapy. There is a section on the philosophy of science, research and research methodology, and one devoted to gestalt therapy and its teaching and research in diverse parts of the world. There is disagreement and critique, for this is not a simple book. It is so packed with information that it serves as both a challenge and a resource. This second edition of the Handbook will take its place as an aid in understanding the evolution of contemporary gestalt therapy and as a guide to the evolving research tradition in gestalt therapy. It rightfully belongs on the shelves of both beginning trainees in gestalt therapy and advanced and experienced practitioners, and certainly represents a resource for practitioner-researchers involved in practice-based research. Philip Brownell, MDiv, PsyD, is a clinical psychologist licensed in North Carolina and Idaho, USA. He works for an integrated healthcare system, and is the Principal Investigator for an international research project funded by the John Templeton Foundation and administered through Brigham Young University to investigate spiritually-integrated processes in gestalt therapy. He is the author of five books and numerous articles, and graduated from an APA-accredited doctoral program in Clinical Psychology at George Fox University, USA. He holds a certificate in professional coaching from the school of leadership at Duquesne University, and a Master of Divinity from Western Seminary, USA. While virologists predict the next pandemic, little attention has been paid to the psychological factors that influence the spread of infection, emotional distress, and social disruption. This book is the first comprehensive analysis of the psychology of pandemics. The Story Cookbook is a comprehensive collection of over 80 story-based activities. This easy-to-follow guide provides a treasure trove of techniques to apply and adapt. It is a must-read for consultants, educators, and leaders using storytelling for positive change. This book explores the human psyche (‘soul’) and its usefulness in a techno-scientific revolution that is often blind to its subject: the human being. It makes a strong intellectual case for the soul by examining consciousness, synchronicity, suffering, and death. Fractal dynamics provide a tool for understanding complexity. This book brings experts together to reconcile dichotomies like mind-brain and subjective-objective, bringing subjective experience into a scientific framework. What can we do about children who withdraw from loving care, or parents lost in the hurts of their own childhood? This book gathers 25 stories from 41 years in infant mental health, revealing how our earliest attachment experiences support or confound our later development. Synthesizing decades of research, this book explores innovations in teaching to enrich the lives of children. It offers practical strategies for educators and parents based on whole child development, creativity, and the power of play. Essential reading. This essential guide to the youth transgender crisis argues social contagion is a key factor in the upsurge. It exposes the perils of medicalization—from puberty blockers to hormones—and offers a vital psychotherapeutic path for families. This book offers Awareness Integration Therapy (AIT), a multi-modality approach synthesizing cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and body-mind theories. AIT is a must-read for clinicians and coaches who desire to offer deep therapeutic work in a brief period of time. This guide provides a clinical and forensic approach to personality disorders, comparing the categorical (ICD-10) and dimensional (ICD-11) classifications. With diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines, it will appeal to psychiatrists, psychologists, and students. This overview of c...",
