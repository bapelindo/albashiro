  "content": "A mental disorder is characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour.  It is usually associated with distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. There are many different types of mental disorders.  Mental disorders may also be referred to as mental health conditions. The latter is a broader term covering mental disorders, psychosocial disabilities and (other) mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm.  This fact sheet focuses on mental disorders as described by the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11). In 2021, nearly 1 in every 7 people (1.1 billion) around the world were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depressive disorders the most common (1). While effective prevention and treatment options exist, most people with mental disorders do not have access to effective care. Many people also experience stigma, discrimination and violations of human rights. In 2021, 359 million people were living with an anxiety disorder including 72 million children and adolescents (1).  Anxiety disorders are characterised by excessive fear and worry and related behavioural disturbances. Symptoms are severe enough to result in significant distress or significant impairment in functioning. There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, such as: generalized anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive worry), panic disorder (characterised by panic attacks), social anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear and worry in social situations), separation anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to whom the person has a deep emotional bond), and others. Effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered. In 2019, 280 million people were living with depression, including 23 million children and adolescents (1). Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in everyday life.  During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. Several other symptoms are also present, which may include poor concentration, feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth, hopelessness about the future, thoughts about dying or suicide, disrupted sleep, changes in appetite or weight, and feeling especially tired or low in energy. People with depression are at an increased risk of suicide. Yet, effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered. In 2021, 37 million people experienced bipolar disorder, including 3.8 milion adolescents aged 10–19 years (1). People with bipolar disorder experience alternating depressive episodes with periods of manic symptoms.  During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day.  Manic symptoms may include euphoria or irritability, increased activity or energy, and other symptoms such as increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and impulsive reckless behaviour.  People with bipolar disorder are at an increased risk of suicide. Yet effective treatment options exist including psychoeducation, reduction of stress and strengthening of social functioning, and medication. PTSD may develop following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events. It is characterised by all of the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present (intrusive me...",
  "summary": "Disorder mental adalah gangguan klinis dalam fungsi kognisi, regulasi emosi, atau perilaku seseorang, yang biasanya menyebabkan rasa sakit atau hambatan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Menurut klasifikasi ICD-11, gangguan mental termasuk dalam kategori kondisi kesehatan mental, yang juga mencakup disabilitas psososial dan keadaan mental lain yang menyebabkan ketegangan, gangguan fungsi, atau risiko terhadap diri sendiri. Pada tahun 2021, sekitar 1 dari 7 orang (1,1 miliar) mengalami gangguan mental, dengan gangguan kecemasan dan depresi paling umum. Dalam tahun yang sama, 359 juta orang mengalami gangguan kecemasan, termasuk 72 juta anak dan remaja. Gangguan kecemasan ditandai dengan kecemasan berlebihan dan gangguan perilaku, seperti kecemasan umum (perasaan cemas berlebihan), gangguan kecemasan sosial (ketakutan di lingkungan sosial), gangguan kecemasan terkait pemisahan, dan gangguan panik. Sementara itu, 280 juta orang mengalami depresi. Meskipun terdapat pengobatan psikologis dan obat yang efektif, sebagian besar orang dengan gangguan mental tidak memiliki akses terhadap perawatan. Banyak juga mengalami stigma, diskriminasi, dan pelanggaran hak asasi manusia. Dalam konteks Islam, pemahaman tentang kesehatan mental dapat diperkuat melalui konsep tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa), yang menekankan pentingnya keseimbangan emosi, kepercayaan diri, dan kepatuhan terhadap nilai-nilai agama. Dengan pendekatan holistik dan integratif, baik dari sisi psikologis maupun spiritual, terapi dan perawatan mental dapat lebih efektif dan terjangkau.",
