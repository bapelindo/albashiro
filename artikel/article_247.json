  "content": "Posted December 31, 2025 | Reviewed by Monica Vilhauer Ph.D. When most people think about schizophrenia, they think about hallucinations or delusions—voices that aren’t there or beliefs that don’t align with reality. These symptoms are often grouped under the term \"positive symptoms\" of schizophrenia and are typically what brings someone into treatment and leads to diagnosis. But for many individuals, positive symptoms are not the beginning of the illness. Long before hallucinations or delusions appear, more subtle and often misunderstood symptoms can emerge early on. These are known as negative symptoms, and they frequently shape long-term functioning far more than psychosis itself. Negative symptoms are a reduction or loss of normal emotional and motivational functioning. They are not simply reactions to illness, personality traits, or side effects of medication—they are a core component of schizophrenia itself. Negative symptoms that specifically affect motivation and emotional expression may include: These symptoms are often misinterpreted as depression, apathy, or a lack of effort. In reality, they reflect changes in brain systems involved in motivation, reward, and emotional expression. These symptoms can often continue to present even when positive symptoms such as hallucinations and/or delusions are well controlled or absent with antipsychotics. Negative symptoms are a core and common part of schizophrenia. Research suggests that nearly 9 out of 10 people experience at least one negative symptom at the time of a first psychotic episode. Even after treatment, an estimated 35–70% continue to experience persistent negative symptoms, despite improvement in hallucinations or delusions. These symptoms are strongly linked to reduced independence, social withdrawal, and difficulty sustaining work, relationships, and meaningful daily roles. Negative symptoms tend to develop gradually and quietly. Unlike hallucinations and delusions, they do not typically trigger urgent clinical attention. They are frequently attributed to stress, personality, medication effects, or “not trying hard enough.” Because of this, negative symptoms are often overlooked. Healthcare professionals can play a key role in recognizing these symptoms over time, but family members and loved ones are also essential partners in care. Those closest to the individual may notice changes in motivation, emotions, or social engagement long before they are raised in a clinical setting. Advocacy from both clinicians and families helps ensure these symptoms are recognized rather than dismissed or misunderstood. A comprehensive approach to managing schizophrenia involves actively asking about negative symptoms, not just monitoring for hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms are best uncovered through thoughtful, open-ended conversations. Clinicians—and when appropriate, caregivers—can help identify these symptoms by asking questions such as: These questions help clarify whether reduced activity or social engagement reflects limited opportunity—or a greater difficulty with motivation, pleasure, or emotional expression. Input from caregivers can be especially valuable, as they often observe gradual changes that may not be obvious during brief clinical visits. Despite how common negative symptoms are and their impact on daily functioning, most antipsychotic medications have a limited effect on negative symptoms. At this time, there are no FDA-approved medications specifically indicated for negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and guideline recommendations for managing negative symptoms remain limited. While some medications—such as cariprazine, olanzapine/samidrophan, and xanomeline–trospium chloride—have shown signals of improvement in negative symptoms in clinical trials, treatment effects can be modest and variable, and can t...",
  "summary": "Gejala negatif skizofreni merupakan bagian penting dari penyakit ini, yang sering diketahui secara terbatas karena biasanya tidak terlihat secara langsung seperti halusinasi atau delusi. Gejala ini terkait dengan penurunan fungsi emosional dan motivasi, bukan hanya reaksi terhadap penyakit, sifat pribadi, atau efek samping obat. Gejala seperti kurangnya motivasi, kehilangan perasaan, dan ketidakmampuan untuk mengikuti aktivitas sehari-hari sering salah dianalisis sebagai depresi atau apatis. Namun, ini merupakan perubahan pada sistem otak yang terkait dengan motivasi, imbalan, dan ekspresi emosi. Gejala negatif muncul secara perlahan dan sering muncul sebelum munculnya gejala positif seperti halusinasi atau delusi. Menurut penelitian, hampir 9 dari 10 pasien mengalami setidaknya satu gejala negatif saat pertama kali mengalami episode psikotik. Bahkan setelah gejala positif terkendali, 35 hingga 70% pasien tetap mengalami gejala negatif. Gejala ini sangat memengaruhi kualitas hidup, menyebabkan kesulitan dalam kebebasan, isolasi sosial, dan kesulitan menjalani pekerjaan, hubungan, atau peran sehari-hari. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, hal ini menekankan pentingnya perawatan holistik, termasuk pengembangan karakter, kepercayaan diri, dan keseimbangan emosional melalui tazkiyatun nufus. Dengan memahami gejala negatif, perawatan dapat lebih terarah, memperbaiki fungsi kognitif dan sosial, serta memperkuat kehidupan sehari-hari pasien secara menyeluruh.",
