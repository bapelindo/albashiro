Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder involving extreme distress and disruption of daily living that happens after exposure to a traumatic event. About 6% of the U.S. population will experience PTSD during their lives. To diagnose PTSD, a mental health professional references the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and evaluates whether or not the patient meets the criteria. The criteria in the fifth edition are somewhat different than the criteria in the fourth edition. The DSM-5 divides PTSD symptoms into four categories: These symptoms are associated with a traumatic event. Each of the four categories includes a group of related symptoms. These symptoms are related to intrusive thoughts and memories of the traumatic event. People with PTSD may avoid people, places, conversations, activities, objects, or situations that bring up memories of the event. They may also avoid thoughts, feelings, or physical sensations that recall the event. People with PTSD may experience a pervasive negative emotional state (for example, shame, anger, or fear). Other symptoms in this category include: People with PTSD often feel constantly \"on guard\" or like danger is lurking around every corner (also known as hypervigilance). Related symptoms include: The first criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD listed in the DSM-5 is exposure to one or more traumatic event(s), which is defined as one that involved death or threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence. Experiencing the event could be direct, but it doesn't have to be. Exposure could also occur indirectly, such as: Once the exposure has occurred, PTSD symptoms are evaluated for a diagnosis. In order to be diagnosed with PTSD, the following criteria should be met: The biggest change in the DSM-5 is removing PTSD from the category of anxiety disorders and putting it in a classification called \"Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders.\" PTSD is caused by exposure to trauma. However, it's not clear why some people develop PTSD after traumatic events while others do not. There are some risk factors that can make someone more likely to develop it than others. For example, genetics may play a role. It's also more common in women than men. There are different types of PTSD, including: Acute stress disorder is related to PTSD. While it shares some symptoms, a PTSD diagnosis requires symptoms are present for more than a month, whereas someone with acute stress disorder could experience symptoms for just three days to one month. Acute and chronic PTSD are no longer used in the DSM-5. Acute referred to PTSD symptoms lasting less than three months and chronic referred to symptoms lasting more than three months. Treatment for PTSD can involve medication, psychotherapy, or both. Consult a mental health professional to find the best treatment for you. Antidepressants, specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are typically considered the first-line medication option to treat PTSD. These can help someone with PTSD with mood, anxiety, eating, and sleep. Zoloft (sertraline) and Paxil (paroxetine) are FDA-approved to treat PTSD. Other drugs that have been shown to be effective for PTSD include Prozac (fluoxetine) as well as Effexor XR (venlafaxine), which is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). In addition, there are other medications that may be used to treat PTSD. Be sure to discuss your options with your healthcare provider. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of talk therapy that has been found to be effective for treating the symptoms of PTSD. ...",
  "summary": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) adalah gangguan psikologis yang muncul setelah seseorang mengalami kejadian traumatis, seperti kehilangan, kecelakaan, atau kekerasan. Menurut DSM-5, diagnosis PTSD melibatkan empat kategori gejala: intrusi (ingatan atau pikiran yang terus muncul), evitasi (menghindari tempat, orang, atau aktivitas yang memicu kenangan traumatis), perubahan emosi (seperti kecemasan, kemarahan, atau rasa bersalah), dan perasaan terus-menerus waspada (hipervigilans). Kriteria utama untuk diagnosis PTSD adalah paparan langsung atau tidak langsung terhadap kejadian traumatis yang melibatkan kematian, ancaman kematian, cedera serius, atau kekerasan seksual. Gejala ini dapat muncul setelah pengalaman langsung, atau melalui pengalaman tidak langsung seperti melihat atau mendengar kejadian traumatis. Kondisi ini memengaruhi kualitas hidup sehari-hari, menyebabkan gangguan kognitif, emosional, dan perilaku. Penanganan PTSD meliputi terapi psikologis, seperti terapi kognitif perilaku (CBT), serta terapi eksposisi, yang membantu individu mengatasi pikiran negatif dan mengurangi respons emosional terhadap rangsangan. Dalam konteks Islam, konsep tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) dapat menjadi pendekatan spiritual yang mendukung pemulihan, dengan memperkuat keimanan, refleksi, dan keberanian menghadapi ketakutan. Dengan pendekatan holistik ini, pasien dapat memperbaiki keseimbangan emosional dan membangun kekuatan spiritual serta psikologis. (198 kata)",
