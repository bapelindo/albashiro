While the terms \"mental instability\" or \"mentally unstable\" may still be used, neither is an official diagnosis and each is highly stigmatizing and offensive. More appropriate terms include \"mental health condition\" and \"mental health disorder.\" Mental instability, while not an official diagnosis, is a very broad term that people use to refer to a wide range of mental health conditions. It's important to note that the terms \"mental instability\" or \"mentally unstable\" carry negative and stigmatizing connotations. Preferred terms include \"mental health condition\" or \"mental health disorder.\" Some common examples of mental health conditions include anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There are a variety of signs that may indicate someone is dealing with a mental health disorder. It is important to remember that not all of these signs will be present in every case and that symptoms look different from person to person. However, some common signs of a mental health disorder include: If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. Some common examples of mental health conditions may include: anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and PTSD. Anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental health disorder in the United States, affecting 40 million adults. Symptoms of anxiety can include excessive worry, racing thoughts, sweating, and difficulty sleeping. Depression is a common mental health condition that can cause a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in activities. Other symptoms of depression can include fatigue, changes in appetite, and difficulty concentrating. Bipolar disorder causes extreme mood swings, from periods of mania to periods of depression. Symptoms of bipolar disorder can include sleep problems, irritability, and changes in energy levels. Schizophrenia is a mental health disorder that causes people to experience delusions and hallucinations. Symptoms of schizophrenia can include social withdrawal, disorganized thinking, and unusual behavior. PTSD is a mental health condition that can develop after exposure to a traumatic event. Symptoms of PTSD can include flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of people or places associated with the trauma. If you are concerned that you or someone you know is dealing with a mental health condition, a mental health professional can assess the situation and provide a diagnosis, if necessary. A big part of how mental health disorders are diagnosed involves looking at how the symptoms affect a person's life. Having a mental condition can affect a person's ability to function normally in daily life. It can also create distress and affect relationships. Below are some of the potential ways that the symptoms caused by a mental health disorder: If you are worried about someone you know, there are a few things you can do to help. It's important to avoid using stigmatizing, judgmental language like \"mentally unstable.\" Instead, talk to them about your concerns and what you've been noticing. This can be a difficult conversation, but it is important to express your support and let the person know that you are there for them. It is also important to encourage the person to seek professional help. Mental health professionals can provide the necessary support and treatment.

  "summary": "Kata \"mentally unstable\" atau \"mental instability\" tidak merupakan diagnosis resmi dan sangat stigmatisir, serta tidak sesuai untuk digunakan dalam konteks psikologi modern. Istilah ini terlalu luas dan mengandung konotasi negatif, sehingga dapat memperparah stigma terhadap kondisi kesehatan mental. Istilah yang lebih tepat adalah \"kondisi kesehatan mental\" atau \"gangguan kesehatan mental\". Kondisi seperti gangguan kecemasan, depresi, gangguan bipolar, schizofrenia, dan trauma pasca-kejadian (PTSD) merupakan contoh gangguan kesehatan mental yang umum. Gejala-gejala seperti kecemasan berlebihan, pikiran cepat, keringat, kesulitan tidur, atau perasaan sedih berkepanjangan dapat menjadi indikator dari gangguan ini. Namun, setiap kasus berbeda, dan gejala tidak selalu sama. Penting untuk memahami bahwa seseorang yang mengalami gangguan mental tidak berarti \"tidak stabil\" atau \"berbahaya\". Sebaliknya, ini adalah kondisi yang memerlukan perhatian, pemahaman, dan dukungan. Jika seseorang mengalami pikiran bunuh diri, segera hubungi layanan bantuan seperti nomor 988 atau 911 jika dalam bahaya. Dalam konteks Islam, konsep tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) juga relevan, karena menekankan pentingnya keseimbangan emosional, kepercayaan diri, dan keberadaan spiritual. Dengan memperbaiki kesadaran akan istilah-istilah yang lebih akurat dan memahami kondisi mental secara objektif, kita dapat mengurangi stigma dan membangun lingkungan yang lebih inklusif dan penuh empati terhadap orang dengan gangguan mental.",
