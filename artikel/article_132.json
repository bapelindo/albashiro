Psychoanalytic therapy is a form of talk therapy based on Sigmund Freud's theories of psychoanalysis. The approach explores how the unconscious mind influences your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Specifically, it examines how your experiences (often from childhood) may be contributing to your current experience and actions. Psychoanalytic approaches to emotional disorders have advanced a great deal since Freud's time. Freud described the unconscious as the reservoir of desires, thoughts, and memories that are below the surface of conscious awareness. He believed that these unconscious influences could often lead to psychological distress and disturbances. People undergoing psychoanalytic therapy often meet with their psychoanalyst at least once a week. They can remain in therapy for months or even years. Psychoanalysts use a variety of techniques to gain insight into your behavior. Some of the more popular techniques include: In addition, during psychoanalysis, you might find that you are experiencing \"transference.\" Transference occurs when you project your feelings about another person onto the psychoanalyst. Talking about these feelings can help your psychoanalyst understand how you interact with others. Psychoanalysts spend a lot of time listening to people talk about their lives, which is why this method is often referred to as \"the talking cure.\" Psychoanalytic therapy may be used to treat a number of different psychological conditions, including: What makes psychoanalytic therapy different from other forms of treatment? A review of the research comparing psychoanalytic approaches to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) identified seven features that set the psychoanalytic approach apart. As with any approach to mental health treatment, psychoanalytic therapy can have its pluses and minuses. Before deciding on this approach, it's important to take these factors into account. Success often hinges on the ability to confront potentially stressful or triggering experiences. While some critics have derided the success rates of psychoanalytic therapy, research suggests that both long- and short-term psychoanalytic therapy can effectively treat a range of conditions. Long-term psychoanalytic therapy is usually defined as lasting one year or 50 sessions. Short-term psychoanalytic therapy, on the other hand, is defined as fewer than 40 sessions or less than one year of treatment. One review of the effectiveness of long-term psychoanalytic therapies found moderate to large success rates for reducing symptoms of a variety of psychopathologies. A 2021 review of studies found that short-term psychoanalytic therapy led to lasting improvements in somatic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. People who receive psychoanalytic treatment tend to retain these gains. Most continue to improve even after therapy ends. On the other hand, the benefits of other evidence-based therapies tend to diminish over time. A 2010 review published in the American Psychologist suggested that psychoanalytic therapy was as effective as other evidence-based therapies. As with all treatment methods, there are also potential downsides that should be considered. This form of therapy tends to require ongoing sessions. Traditional psychoanalysis could involve three to five sessions a week for several years, however psychoanalysis psychotherapy is less frequent and may be undertaken once to twice a week. Depending on how long your therapy lasts, the costs can mount up. Psychoanalytic therapy can also be an intense process. It involves evoking emotional responses and often challenges established defense mechanisms. While the process can sometimes result in uneasiness, it...",
  "summary": "Terapi psikologis analitis adalah bentuk terapi berbasis teori psianalisis Sigmund Freud, yang menekankan peran pikiran bawah sadar dalam memengaruhi pikiran, perasaan, dan perilaku seseorang. Terapi ini menganggap bahwa pengalaman masa kecil, terutama dari masa kanak-kanakan, dapat memengaruhi perilaku dan perasaan saat ini. Dalam terapi ini, individu berdiskusi secara mendalam dengan psikolog analis, yang memahami bagaimana konflik batin dan keinginan tersembunyi memengaruhi kehidupan sehari-hari. Salah satu fenomena penting dalam terapi ini adalah *transferensi*, yaitu ketika seseorang memproyeksikan perasaan terhadap orang lain ke terapis. Dengan memahami ini, terapis dapat mengidentifikasi pola perilaku dan hubungan yang terkait dengan masa lalu. Terapi ini biasanya berlangsung secara rutin, bahkan bertahun-tahun, dengan fokus pada pemahaman mendalam terhadap pengalaman hidup. Meskipun telah berkembang sejak zaman Freud, terapi ini tetap menekankan \"penyembuhan melalui percakapan\" atau \"the talking cure\". Terapi psikologis analitis dapat digunakan untuk mengatasi berbagai gangguan psikologis, seperti depresi, kecemasan, dan gangguan hubungan. Meskipun berbeda dari terapi kognitif perilaku (CBT), terapi analitis memiliki keunikan seperti fokus pada konflik batin, pengaruh masa lalu, dan transference. Namun, keberhasilannya masih dipertanyakan secara ilmiah, terutama dalam konteks terapi modern. Dalam konteks Islam, konsep ini bisa dikaitkan dengan *tazkiyatun nufus* (pengembangan akhlak dan kesadaran batin), di mana perhatian terhadap perasaan dan pikiran batin juga ditekankan sebagai bagian dari perawatan mental.",
