PhotoAlto / Frederic Cirou / Getty Images Agitated depression (AD) is a relatively severe type of clinical depression that combines the persistent sadness, pessimism, low energy, and low or \"empty\" mood of typical depression with agitated symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, restlessness, excessive talking, fidgeting, and/or angry outbursts. This mental health condition may also be referred to as unipolar, mixed state, mixed features, mixed mania, depression with psychomotor agitation, or mixed episode depression. There are many types of depression which, as a group of mental health disorders, affect over 264 million people of all ages worldwide. AD is one way depression manifests. The diagnosis remains somewhat controversial and inconsistent (for example, some clinicians prefer to use the diagnosis of depression with mixed features or consider it part of bipolar disorder) as the characteristics of the condition overlap with a variety of other types of depression. However, researchers and clinicians are increasingly understanding that depression, mania, and mental health, in general, exist on a spectrum, which is why various names may be used to describe a person's depression and that each person does not necessarily exhibit all of the possible symptoms. Generally, a person with agitated depression experiences the intense malaise, lack of energy, hopelessness, and apathy of typical depression as well as an urge to act out, which is often expressed in volatile behavior, insomnia, negative mood, racing thoughts, and a short temper. While these symptoms may also occur in depression, for those with agitated depression these issues are more pronounced and persistent.

Agitated depression is diagnosed by your doctor, psychiatrist, and/or mental health provider. Your practitioner will review your symptoms and medical history before making their diagnosis. As noted above, the diagnosis of this disorder is not entirely straightforward as it overlaps with several types of depression. Sometimes, a person is diagnosed with depression first and then agitated depression later, once the nuances of their condition come to light in therapy. Your mental health provider will carefully evaluate your condition by observing your moods and behavior. They will also take your medical and mental health history and learn more about your experiences in talk therapy in order to distinguish agitated depression from other possible issues, such as bipolar disorder.

  "summary": "Depresi yang agitasi (agitated depression) adalah bentuk depresi yang cukup berat, yang menggabungkan gejala klasik depresi seperti kehilangan semangat, rasa pesimisme, kelelahan, dan perasaan kosong, dengan gejala agitasi seperti iritasi, kecemasan, ketegangan, berbicara berlebihan, gerakan tidak tenang, atau ekspresi marah. Kondisi ini juga dikenal sebagai depresi dengan fitur campuran, mixed state, atau bahkan bagian dari gangguan bipolar. Meskipun istilah ini masih kontroversial dan tidak selalu konsisten digunakan—beberapa profesional lebih memilih istilah seperti depresi dengan fitur campuran atau memasukkannya dalam diagnosis gangguan bipolar—peneliti dan praktisi kesehatan mental semakin menyadari bahwa depresi, mania, dan gangguan mental secara umum berada pada spektrum yang saling terkait. Hal ini berarti bahwa setiap individu dapat menunjukkan kombinasi gejala yang berbeda. Orang dengan depresi agitasi biasanya mengalami perasaan malaise yang intens, kehilangan energi, rasa putus asa, serta dorongan untuk bertindak, yang sering berujung pada perilaku tidak stabil, insomnia, dan perasaan negatif. Kondisi ini memerlukan pendekatan klinis yang terperinci, karena gejalanya sering menyerupai mania atau depresi biasa. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemahaman terhadap kondisi ini dapat diperkuat melalui prinsip tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa), dengan menekankan pentingnya keseimbangan emosi, kestabilan mental, dan keterhubungan antara fisik, rohani, dan sosial. Penanganan yang komprehensif, termasuk terapi dan dukungan spiritual, sangat penting untuk memulihkan kesehatan mental secara holistik.",
