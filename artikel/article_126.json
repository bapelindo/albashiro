  "content": "Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. The DSM-5 outlines the criteria that professionals use to diagnose substance use disorders, which helps them better identify harmful patterns and behavior when it comes to alcohol and drug use. It lists 11 key signs that indicate that a disorder may be present, including cravings, a loss of control, and withdrawal symptoms. Being able to recognize these criteria can help with early intervention and treatment. Substance use disorders span a wide variety of problems arising from substance use, and cover 11 different criteria: The 11 criteria outlined in the DSM-5-TR can be grouped into four primary categories: physical dependence, risky use, social problems, and impaired control. It is important to note that people can experience tolerance and withdrawal in the context of taking prescription drugs to treat a medical or mental health condition. However, this does not necessarily mean that they have a substance use disorder. The \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\", Fifth Edition, text revision, often called the DSM-V-TR or DSM-5-TR, is the latest version of the American Psychiatric Association’s gold-standard text on the names, symptoms, and diagnostic features of every recognized mental illness, including addictions. The DSM-5-TR criteria for substance use disorders are based on decades of research and clinical knowledge. The DSM-5-TR was published in 2013, and in 2022, a text revision was published that included updated criteria for more than 70 disorders, including the requirements for stimulant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder. The DSM-5-TR recognizes substance-related disorders resulting from the use of 10 separate classes of drugs: While some major groupings of psychoactive substances are specifically identified, the use of other or unknown substances can also form the basis of a substance-related or addictive disorder. The activation of the brain’s reward system drives many of the problems tied to drug use. The rewarding feeling people experience due to taking drugs may be so profound that they neglect other normal activities in favor of taking the drug. The pharmacological mechanisms for each class of drug are different. However, the activation of the reward system is similar across substances in producing feelings of pleasure or euphoria, often referred to as a \"high.\" The DSM-5-TR recognizes that people are not all automatically or equally vulnerable to developing substance-related disorders. Some people have lower levels of self-control that predispose them to develop problems if exposed to drugs. There are two groups of substance-related disorders: substance-use disorders and substance-induced disorders. Substance-induced disorders involve problems that are caused by the effects of substances. Types of substance-induced disorders recognized in the DSM-5-TR include substance-induced mental disorders, intoxication, and withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced mental disorders are mental problems that develop in people who did not have mental health problems before using substances. They include: In the text revision of the DSM-5, the information on substance-induced mild neurocognitive disorders was updated to include symptoms caused by stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. Such additions were made in response to research demonstrating that prolonged stimulant use can produce lingering neurocognitive effects on learning, memory, and executive function. Substance intoxication, a group of substance-induced disorders, details the symptoms that people experience when they are under the influence of drugs. Disorders of substance intoxication include: Substance withdrawal involves experiencing physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms due to reducing or halting substance use. To be diagnosed with withdrawal, these symptoms must not be due ...",
  "summary": "Manual Diagnostik Kecanduan (DSM-5-TR) merupakan panduan standar dari American Psychiatric Association yang digunakan untuk mendiagnosis gangguan penggunaan zat, termasuk kecanduan alkohol dan obat. Manual ini menyebutkan 11 kriteria utama yang mencakup gejala seperti keinginan kuat, kehilangan kendali, dan gejala penarikan. Kriteria ini dibagi keempat kategori utama: ketergantungan fisik, penggunaan berisiko, masalah sosial, dan gangguan kontrol. Meskipun terjadi toleransi atau gejala penarikan saat menggunakan obat terapi untuk kondisi medis atau gangguan mental, ini tidak otomatis berarti seseorang mengalami gangguan kecanduan. DSM-5-TR mengenali 10 kelas obat yang dapat menyebabkan gangguan, termasuk zat psikotropik. Kriteria ini didasarkan pada penelitian dan pengalaman klinis selama bertahun-tahun. Versi revisi tahun 2022 memperbarui lebih dari 70 gangguan, termasuk kriteria baru untuk gangguan neurokognitif ringan akibat stimulan. Dengan memahami kriteria ini, profesional kesehatan mental dapat mengidentifikasi pola perilaku berbahaya lebih awal dan memberikan intervensi dan perawatan yang tepat. Pemahaman terhadap kriteria DSM-5-TR sangat penting untuk diagnosis akurat dan pengelolaan kondisi kecanduan secara efektif. Dalam konteks Islam, konsep tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) juga dapat dipertimbangkan sebagai pendekatan spiritual untuk mengatasi kecanduan, dengan menekankan pada keberanian, kesabaran, dan ketaatan kepada Allah.",
