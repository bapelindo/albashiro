  "content": "Kendra Cherry, MS, is a psychosocial rehabilitation specialist, psychology educator, and author of the \"Everything Psychology Book.\" Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Mental illness affects how people behave, think, and feel, which can impact many areas of a person's life, including their ability to work, cope with challenges, and relate to others. If you have a family member with a mental illness, you may wonder whether mental illness is genetic and about your own risk of developing a mental health condition. While researchers have long recognized that mental illnesses tend to run in families, having a family member with a mental disorder is no guarantee that you will have the same condition. This article explores whether mental illness is genetic and the different factors that affect your overall risk of developing a mental disorder. The exact causes of mental illness are not fully understood, but genetics appear to be one piece of the puzzle. Researchers have long noted that certain conditions tend to run families, partly because of genetics, but also because of environmental factors such as shared upbringing. Certain mental health conditions appear to be more closely tied to genetics, and research suggests that there are shared genetic factors that appear to play a part in causing these disorders. However, genes alone are not responsible for causing mental illness. And no single gene variant could determine with certainty that a person will have a mental illness. In other words, just because you have family members with a mental disorder does not mean you will develop it. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mental illness does not have a single cause. Instead, it is often influenced by several factors, including: In one study published in The Lancet, scientists found that certain genetic glitches were associated with five disorders, suggesting a shared underlying genetic vulnerability. These conditions share variations in two genes that influence the development of the cellular structure responsible for regulating the calcium flow in neurons. This calcium flow plays an essential role in neurotransmission. This part of the brain's circuitry is linked to several essential mental functions, such as attention, thinking, memory, and emotion. Disrupted neurotransmission can result in problems often associated with different mental health conditions. While such findings are significant, researchers caution that these genetic variations account for only a small portion of the potential risk for mental illness. Other factors also play a part. Environmental factors often interact with genetic predispositions to increase a person's risk. Such findings may play an essential role in the future treatment of mental health conditions. Rather than looking primarily at symptoms to diagnose a condition, mental health professionals may one day be able to look at the underlying biology of the condition. This may lead to the development of new treatments that are based on a disease's biology and not the symptoms that they have. Currently, no genetic tests can determine if you have specific genes or gene combinations that might make you more vulnerable to a specific mental disorder. Instead, looking at your family history may offer clues about your possible risk. Some mental disorders tend to run in families, so if you have a close relative with a condition, it might mean that your risk is higher. However, having a family member with a disorder doesn't necessarily mean that you will also develop the condition. But, understanding the risk may help you be more alert to early symptoms. Recognizing symptoms can lead to earlier treatment and better outcomes. Determining your own specific risk is complicated, and estimates vary for different conditions. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two conditions that are ...",
  "summary": "Mental illness tidak sepenuhnya disebabkan oleh faktor genetik, meskipun ada hubungan antara keluarga dan kondisi psikologis tertentu. Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa beberapa gangguan mental, seperti depresi atau gangguan kecemasan, memiliki keterkaitan genetik, namun faktor lingkungan juga memainkan peran penting. Genetika hanya merupakan salah satu dari banyak faktor yang memengaruhi risiko mengalami gangguan mental. Tidak ada satu varian gen yang dapat menjamin seseorang akan mengalami gangguan psikologis. Faktor lain seperti lingkungan, stres, kebiasaan, dan pengalaman hidup juga sangat memengaruhi perkembangan kondisi mental. Penelitian dalam *The Lancet* menunjukkan bahwa beberapa ketidakseimbangan genetik terkait dengan lima gangguan mental, menandakan adanya faktor genetik bersama. Namun, ini tidak berarti bahwa seseorang akan mengalami gangguan hanya karena memiliki keluarga dengan gangguan mental. Kombinasi antara faktor genetik dan lingkungan, seperti kehidupan keluarga, stres, dan pengalaman masa kecil, menentukan risiko secara keseluruhan. Dalam konteks Islam, pemahaman tentang tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) dan keseimbangan emosi menekankan pentingnya peran akhlak, ibadah, dan kehidupan bermasyarakat dalam mencegah gangguan mental. Oleh karena itu, meskipun faktor genetik bisa memengaruhi risiko, pengelolaan kehidupan sehari-hari, kepercayaan diri, dan keberanian menghadapi tantangan tetap menjadi kunci utama dalam mencegah dan mengelola gangguan mental.",
