Michela Buttignol for Verywell Mind / Stocksy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapeutic treatment that helps people learn how to identify and change the destructive or disturbing thought patterns that have a negative influence on their behavior and emotions. Cognitive behavioral therapy combines cognitive therapy with behavior therapy by identifying maladaptive patterns of thinking, emotional responses, or behaviors and replacing them with more desirable or helpful patterns. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on changing the automatic negative thoughts that can contribute to and worsen our emotional difficulties, depression, and anxiety. These spontaneous negative thoughts also have a detrimental influence on our mood. Through CBT, faulty thoughts are identified, challenged, and replaced with more objective, realistic thoughts. This video has been medically reviewed by Steven Gans, MD. CBT encompasses a range of techniques and approaches that address our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. These can range from structured psychotherapies to self-help practices. Some of the specific types of therapeutic approaches that involve cognitive behavioral therapy include: While each type of cognitive behavioral therapy takes a different approach, all work to address the underlying thought patterns that contribute to psychological distress. CBT is about more than identifying thought patterns. It uses a wide range of strategies to help people overcome these patterns. Here are just a few examples of techniques used in cognitive behavioral therapy. It is important to learn what thoughts, feelings, and situations are contributing to maladaptive, unhelpful, or harmful behaviors. This process can be difficult, however, especially for people who struggle with introspection. But taking the time to identify these thoughts can lead to self-discovery and provide insights that are essential to the treatment process. In cognitive behavioral therapy, people are often taught new skills that can be used in real-world situations. For example, someone with a substance use disorder might practice new coping skills and rehearse ways to avoid or deal with social situations that could potentially trigger a relapse. Goal setting can be an important step in recovery from mental illness, helping you to make changes to improve your health and life. During cognitive behavioral therapy, a therapist can help you build and strengthen your goal-setting skills. This might involve teaching you how to identify your goal or how to distinguish between short- and long-term goals. It may also include helping you set SMART goals (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based), with a focus on the process as much as the end outcome. Learning problem-solving skills during cognitive behavioral therapy can help you learn how to identify and solve problems that may arise from life stressors, both big and small. It can also help reduce the negative impact of psychological and physical illness. Problem-solving in CBT often involves five steps: Also known as diary work, self-monitoring is an important cognitive behavioral therapy technique. It involves tracking behaviors, symptoms, or experiences over time and sharing them with your therapist. Self-monitoring can provide your therapist with the information they need to give you the best treatment. For example, for people with eating disorders, self-monitoring may involve keeping track of eating habits, as well as any thoughts or feelings that went along with consuming a meal or snack.

  "summary": "Kognitif perilaku terapi (CBT) adalah pendekatan psikoterapi yang membantu individu mengenali dan mengubah pola pikir negatif yang memengaruhi emosi dan perilaku mereka. CBT menggabungkan terapi kognitif dan terapi perilaku, memfokuskan pada pola pikir yang tidak sehat dan menggantikannya dengan pola yang lebih realistis dan membantu. Terapi ini menekankan pengenalan terhadap pikiran otomatis negatif yang memperparah kecemasan, depresi, dan gangguan emosional. Dengan mengidentifikasi, menantang, dan mengganti pikiran yang keliru, individu dapat mengurangi ketegangan emosional dan meningkatkan kesehatan mental. CBT menggunakan berbagai teknik, mulai dari terapi struktural hingga praktik mandiri, untuk mengatasi pola pikir, perasaan, dan perilaku yang merugikan. Terapi ini tidak hanya membantu mengenali pola pikir, tetapi juga memberikan strategi konkret untuk mengelola stres, kecemasan, dan depresi. CBT sangat efektif dalam mengurangi gejala gangguan psikologis karena menekankan pada perubahan nyata dalam cara seseorang berpikir dan bertindak. Dalam konteks Islam, prinsip ini sejalan dengan tazkiyatun nufus (pengembangan akhlak dan kebaikan dalam diri), karena menekankan kesadaran, refleksi, dan perbaikan diri. Dengan mengganti pola pikir negatif, individu dapat memperkuat kepercayaan diri dan keseimbangan emosional, sesuai dengan nilai-nilai kebaikan dan kehidupan yang bermakna dalam agama. CBT adalah alat yang kuat untuk membangun kehidupan yang lebih sehat secara mental dan spiritual.",
