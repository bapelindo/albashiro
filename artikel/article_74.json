I've reviewed 55 services to find the best, most affordable online therapy Hannah Owens is a licensed social worker with clinical experience in community mental health, and is the Mental Health Editor for Verywell Mind as well as the Associate Editor for GROUP, the Eastern Group Psychotherapy Society's academic journal. Hannah has worked at Verywell Mind since 2022, and during that time, has overseen extensive testing of 55 different online therapy services and 27 online therapy directories, both for individuals and couples. This gives Hannah expertise in the online therapy field, where she uses the insights gained from over three years of testing to be able to knowledgeably recommend therapy services to a wide variety of therapy seekers. Hannah also uses her clinical experience to act as a subject matter expert for Verywell Mind articles about mental health conditions and services. Online therapy offers you the convenience and privacy of appointments from the comfort of your own home, and it’s usually cheaper and more widely available than in-person therapy. However, as a licensed social worker and former therapist, I can assure you that not all services are created equal. To find the best online therapy services, I’ve spent the last three years researching and extensively testing 55 different companies, racking up hundreds of reviews and thousands of pages of personal insights from testers all across the country. After parsing all this information, I’ve built this online therapy guide, in which I’ll share everything you need to know about all the major online therapy platforms. How much does it cost? The services we recommend cost anywhere from $55 per session to over $200. Who is it for? Someone who wants to work through challenges, improve their overall wellbeing, or receive help for a mild or moderate mental health condition. It is not for people dealing with serious mental illness or who are in crisis or suicidal. Will insurance cover it? Maybe. Most companies list the insurance plans they accept or let you search for your plan when signing up. I’ve noted the online therapy services on our list that accept insurance. Is it confidential? Be sure to read through any company’s privacy policy to better understand whether it is HIPAA-compliant (HIPAA is the law that protects personal health information) and whether it shares any private information with third parties; we recommend opting out of data collection. How do we meet? You can talk to your therapist via video chat, phone, or text, for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour or more. Does online therapy work? That depends on your commitment to doing the hard stuff, the skill of your therapist, and the services offered by the company. For this reason, don't be afraid to switch therapists until you find the right match. Once these elements come together, you’ll be surprised at how effective therapy can be. Here is a breakdown of the online therapy research and testing process on Verywell Mind. I had 65 different people sign up for talk therapy with all 55 online therapy companies reviewed. Over the past three years, I’ve published 153 reviews (here are our reviews for BetterHelp and Talkspace, for instance). I had my testers try out each company's therapy services, and if the company offered other services (like couples therapy and kid or teen therapy) we tested those too. I asked each tester to try each service for at least a month, which usually meant between two and six sessions at each company. I also asked testers to switch therapists partway through, if possible, in order to get a holistic idea of the offerings and quality of each company. My testers were located all across the United States and abroad, meaning I gained extensive information about each company's services in a variety of areas. I surveyed more than 8,000 thera...",
  "summary": "Artikel ini membahas penilaian terbaik dari layanan terapi online berdasarkan evaluasi oleh seorang psikolog terlatih, Hannah Owens, seorang perawat sosial yang memiliki pengalaman klinis di bidang kesehatan mental komunitas. Dalam waktu tiga tahun terakhir, Hannah telah menguji 55 layanan terapi online dan 27 direktori terapi online, baik untuk individu maupun pasangan, untuk menemukan yang paling efektif dan terjangkau. Meskipun terapi online memberikan keuntungan seperti kenyamanan, privasi, dan biaya yang lebih rendah dibandingkan terapi langsung, tidak semua layanan sama kualitasnya. Artikel ini menawarkan rekomendasi terbaik berdasarkan data dan pengalaman nyata dari pengujian yang luas. Biaya layanan bervariasi, mulai dari $55 hingga lebih dari $200 per sesi. Layanan ini cocok bagi mereka yang ingin mengatasi tantangan, meningkatkan kesehatan mental, atau mendapatkan bantuan untuk kondisi mental ringan hingga sedang. Namun, layanan ini tidak direkomendasikan untuk kondisi mental yang parah atau membutuhkan intervensi intensif. Artikel ini juga menekankan pentingnya memilih layanan yang sesuai dengan kebutuhan pribadi, serta memperhatikan kualitas layanan, keamanan data, dan kepercayaan terhadap profesional. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, hal ini dapat dikaitkan dengan prinsip *tazkiyatun nufus* (perbaikan jiwa), di mana kesehatan mental dan keberadaan spiritual harus dipertahankan melalui kebijaksanaan, refleksi, dan konsistensi dalam memilih metode perawatan yang sesuai dengan nilai-nilai kehidupan.",
