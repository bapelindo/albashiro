Unfortunately, by themselves, psychotherapy and antidepressants only achieve full relief from symptoms in about 38 percent of treated patients. Combining psychotherapy and antidepressants modestly improves the outcomes. Clearly, more must be done for patients with MDD who have only a partial improvement from psychotherapy and/or antidepressants. Fortunately, there are several options, including adding additional medications, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, intranasal esketamine, and lifestyle interventions. Lifestyle interventions typically include behavioral activation (engaging in enjoyable, meaningful, or mastery-building activities, engaging in physical exercise, etc.), enhancing relationships, improving sleep, and dietary changes. Utilizing food and fluids to improve mental health is receiving greater attention due to increasing interest in nutritional psychiatry. What we eat and drink is vitally important for brain health, but what is equally important is what not to eat. Limiting ultra-processed foods is one of the most important nutrition-related things we can do to enhance our health, including brain health. In fact, \"...greater ultra-purified food intake, particularly artificial sweeteners and artificially sweetened beverages, is associated with increased risk of depression\" (Samuthpongtorn, 2023). Although dietary interventions are used to treat a range of mental disorders, this review is focused on depression. We know that \"diet and nutrition play significant roles in the prevention of depression and its clinical treatment\" (Huang, 2019). The SMILES trial treated adults with Major depressive disorder and poor dietary habits with a modified Mediterranean diet. The primary modification was allowing research subjects to include additional red meat in their diets. It was a randomized, controlled research study, which improved the quality of foods eaten and was \"associated with changes in depressive symptoms\" (Opie, 2018). The control group was provided with social support without any recommendations about altering their diet. They did not have the same reduction in depressive symptoms as the treatment group. The Mediterranean diet is the traditional diet of Greek and Southern Italian people. It is based on plant foods, healthy fats (especially extra-virgin olive oil), fish, only small amounts of red meat, and few, if any, ultra-processed foods. The diet consists of a daily intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, and lots of olive oil. The food is eaten slowly. This diet is beneficial for patients with depression who are also receiving standard treatment, such as psychotherapy and/or antidepressants. Food is not used as a treatment by itself, but as an adjunctive treatment (Nicolaou, 2020). One of the ways that the Mediterranean diet benefits depression is due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. A significant percentage of depressed patients have systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (unstable molecules that injure cells). Reducing inflammation and oxidative stress plays a role in preventing and treating depression. A second dietary treatment for depression is the ketogenic diet. Currently, we do not have sufficient controlled research data to recommend it for use in preventing and treating depression routinely. It is considered semi-experimental and should be overseen by a physician and a nutritionist. It is recommended to be an adjunctive treatment only. Nevertheless, there is data that the ketogenic diet can be helpful for depression. It is a low-carbohydrate diet that allows only 20 to 50 grams of carbohydrate per day. It is high in fats and moderate...",
  "summary": "Depresi adalah gangguan mental yang memengaruhi sekitar 10,4% orang dewasa dalam setahun dan 20,6% sepanjang hidup. Meskipun terapi psikologis dan obat antidepresan hanya berhasil menyembuhkan sekitar 38% pasien, kombinasi kedua pendekatan memberikan perbaikan yang masih terbatas. Oleh karena itu, intervensi gaya hidup seperti perubahan pola makan menjadi pilihan penting. Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa makanan dan minuman berperan besar dalam kesehatan otak, terutama dalam pencegahan dan perawatan depresi. Makanan yang terlalu diproses, seperti makanan olahan dan minuman dengan pemanis buatan, dikaitkan dengan risiko meningkatkan depresi. Dalam studi SMILES, pasien dengan depresi berat dan kebiasaan makan buruk diberi diet Mediterania yang diperbaiki, dengan memperbolehkan konsumsi daging merah sebagai penambahan. Hasilnya menunjukkan bahwa perubahan pola makan dapat memengaruhi perbaikan gejala depresi. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, konsep *tazkiyatun nufus* (pengembangan akhlak dan kebaikan dalam diri) juga mendukung pentingnya perawatan diri, termasuk memilih makanan sehat dan menghindari hal-hal yang merusak. Maka, makanan bukan hanya kebutuhan fisik, tetapi bagian dari keseimbangan mental dan spiritual. Dengan memilih makanan alami, menghindari makanan olahan, dan memperbaiki pola konsumsi, individu dapat memperkuat kesehatan mental secara holistik. Perubahan gaya hidup, terutama dalam aspek nutrisi, menjadi salah satu langkah praktis dan efektif dalam mengelola depresi.",
