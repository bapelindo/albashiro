  "content": "If you worry constantly, it may be worth consulting a mental health professional Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) can be a challenge to diagnose. People consider panic attacks a hallmark of all anxiety disorders, but GAD is different in that there are generally no panic attacks associated with the condition. As a result of this misconception, without the experience of panic attacks, a person may think they are \"just worrying too much.\" Their struggles with constant worry may be minimized or dismissed and, in turn, not properly diagnosed or treated. Most of us experience worry and situations that can cause us to feel anxious, so what are professionals looking for to help determine if someone's worry and anxiety are related to GAD? The first step is to evaluate symptom criteria, as outlined in \"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\" 5th Edition, Text Revision (also known as the DSM-5-TR). Mental health professionals look for factors like excessive, hindering worry paired with a variety of physical symptoms, then use proven diagnostic assessments to make a diagnosis and rule out other possibilities. We've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. Find out which option is the best for you. The DSM-5-TR outlines specific criteria to help professionals diagnose generalized anxiety disorder. Having a standard set of symptoms to reference when assessing clients helps them to more accurately diagnose mental health concerns and, in turn, create a more effective plan of care. When assessing for GAD, clinical professionals are looking for the following: Excessive worry means worrying even when there is no specific threat present or in a manner that is disproportionate to the actual risk.﻿﻿﻿ Someone struggling with GAD experiences a high percentage of their waking hours worrying about something. The worry may be accompanied by reassurance-seeking from others.﻿﻿﻿ In adults, the worry can be about job responsibilities or performance, one’s own health or the health of family members, financial matters, and other everyday, typical life circumstances. In children, the worry is more likely to be about their abilities or the quality of their performance (for example, in school).﻿﻿﻿ Many people with GAD also experience symptoms such as sweating, nausea, or diarrhea.﻿﻿﻿ The anxiety, worry, and other associated symptoms make it hard to carry out day-to-day activities and responsibilities. They may cause problems in relationships, at work, or in other important areas of life.﻿﻿﻿ In order to give a diagnosis of GAD, these symptoms also must be unrelated to any other medical conditions and cannot be explained by a different mental disorder or by the effect of substance use, including prescription medication, alcohol, or recreational drugs.﻿﻿﻿ During an assessment, your clinician will use the diagnostic criteria, standardized assessments, and their clinical judgment to make a diagnosis. Generally, they will ask about your symptoms in an open-ended way, but you may also be asked to complete self-report questionnaires. These typically brief measures can help determine the diagnosis (as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 does) or severity of symptoms.﻿﻿ In specialized care settings, like an anxiety disorders clinic, standardized assessment tools are sometimes used to evaluate symptoms. In this case, your clinician conducts a semi-structured interview. The interview is likely to include a standardized set of questions, and your answers will help your clinician to make an accurate diagnosis. Commonly used and well-validated diagnostic interviews for adults include the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID) and the Anxiety and Related Disorder...",
  "summary": "Disorder kecemasan umum (GAD) adalah kondisi psikologis yang ditandai dengan kecemasan berlebihan dan berkepanjangan, tanpa adanya serangan panik yang khas seperti pada gangguan kecemasan lain. Kecemasan ini tidak terkait dengan ancaman spesifik, namun terjadi secara berlebihan dan tidak seimbang terhadap risiko nyata. Kondisi ini sering kali dianggap hanya sebagai \"permasalahan pikiran\" atau kecemasan biasa, sehingga tidak mendapat perhatian medis yang memadai. Diagnosis GAD didasarkan pada kriteria yang ditetapkan dalam DSM-5-TR, yaitu kecemasan berlebihan yang mengganggu kehidupan sehari-hari, disertai dengan berbagai gejala fisik seperti ketegangan otot, kesulitan tidur, dan perasaan tidak nyaman. Profesional kesehatan mental memeriksa apakah kecemasan tersebut berlangsung secara berkepanjangan dan mengganggu fungsi sehari-hari. Karena tidak ada serangan panik, banyak orang salah menganggap kecemasan mereka hanya sebagai perasaan cemas biasa. Untuk mendiagnosis GAD secara akurat, perlu evaluasi mendalam terhadap pola pikir dan gejala fisik. Penanganan GAD melibatkan pendekatan terapi yang terukur dan pengawasan profesional. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, konsep tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) juga relevan, karena menekankan pentingnya keseimbangan emosi, ketenangan batin, dan kepercayaan pada Allah sebagai bentuk perlindungan mental. Oleh karena itu, perawatan GAD tidak hanya melibatkan terapi, tetapi juga integrasi nilai-nilai spiritual dalam menjaga kesehatan mental.",
