To live mindfully is to live in the moment and reawaken oneself to the present, rather than dwelling on the past or anticipating the future. To be mindful is to observe and label thoughts, feelings, sensations in the body in an objective manner. Mindfulness can therefore be a tool to avoid self-criticism and judgment while identifying and managing difficult emotions. Mindfulness is rooted in Buddhist and Hindu teachings. Buddhism includes a journey toward enlightenment, and the concept of “sati,”—which encompasses attention, awareness, and being present—is considered the first step toward enlightenment. The term was roughly translated from the ancient language Pali into the term “mindfulness.” The emergence of mindfulness in Western culture can be attributed to Jon Kabat-Zinn. Kabat-Zinn studied mindfulness under several Buddhist teachers, such as Philip Kapleau and Thich Nhat Hanh. As a professor at the University of Massachusetts medical school in the late 1970s, Kabat-Zinn developed a program called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to treat chronic pain. He discovered that patients would often try to avoid pain—but that that avoidance would lead to deeper distress. Practicing mindfulness was a more successful approach. As mindfulness shifted into mainstream science and medicine, it became a pivotal therapeutic technique; it was integrated into Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, among others. Mindfulness encompasses two key ingredients: awareness and acceptance. Awareness is the knowledge and ability to focus attention on one’s inner processes and experiences, such as the experience of the present moment. Acceptance is the ability to observe and accept—rather than judge or avoid—those streams of thought. The goal of mindfulness is to cultivate perspective on one’s consciousness and identity that can bring greater peace mentally and relationally. Mindfulness may also be used in mindfulness-based therapies, to address stress, anxiety, or pain, and simply to become more relaxed. Mindfulness has its origins in Buddhist and Hindu teachings, from which the concept “sati” was roughly translated to “mindfulness.” The practice was popularized in the West through the work of Jon-Kabat Zinn. Zinn created Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction to treat pain, anxiety, and stress, and he ultimately brought mindfulness into mainstream clinical practice. Flow is a state in which one is completely absorbed in an activity and loses self-awareness. Flow and mindfulness both involve deep concentration—but only flow involves goal-directed behavior. While mindfulness channels concentration entirely toward the present moment, flow channels concentration toward skills and goal achievement, which might include thoughts of the past and future and judgment of those thoughts. Mindfulness is one form of meditation. Meditation utilizes various practices to quiet the mind or achieve a higher level of consciousness, one of which is mindfulness. Mindfulness can be cultivated within or outside of formal meditation and woven into any activity, such as taking a walk or being engaged in conversation. A person’s experience of time tends to be subjective and heavily influenced by their emotional state. Fears and insecurities about the past and the future can make it difficult to fully appreciate the present. The key is learning how to pay attention. Mindfulness can take place through meditation sessions or smaller moments throughout the day. To cultivate a state of mindfulness, you can begin by sitting down and taking deep breaths. Focus on each breath and the sensations of the moment, such as sounds, scents, the temperature, and the feeling of air passing in and out of the body...",
  "summary": "Mindfulness adalah keadaan yang melibatkan perhatian aktif dan terbuka terhadap momen saat ini, tanpa menghakimi pikiran atau perasaan. Dalam keadaan ini, seseorang mengamati pikiran, perasaan, dan sensasi tubuh secara objektif, tanpa menilai baik atau buruk. Mindfulness membantu seseorang hidup di saat ini, bukan terjebak pada masa lalu atau ke depan. Konsep ini berasal dari ajaran Buddha dan Hindu, khususnya dari istilah \"sati\" yang berarti kesadaran dan perhatian terhadap kehadiran saat ini—langkah awal menuju kepada kebijaksanaan. Dalam budaya Barat, mindfulness dikembangkan oleh Jon Kabat-Zinn, seorang profesor di Universitas Massachusetts, yang mempelajari keilmuan ini dari guru-guru Buddha seperti Philip Kapleau dan Thich Nhat Hanh. Ia menciptakan program Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) untuk mengatasi rasa sakit kronis, menemukan bahwa menghindari rasa sakit justru memperparah kecemasan. Seiring waktu, mindfulness menjadi teknik terapeutik utama, terintegrasi dalam terapi seperti Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, dan Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Dua komponen utama mindfulness adalah kesadaran dan penerimaan. Kesadaran adalah kemampuan untuk fokus pada proses dan pengalaman batin, seperti perasaan saat ini. Penerimaan adalah kemampuan untuk mengamati dan menerima pergerakan pikiran tanpa menghakimi atau menghindarinya. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, mindfulness dapat dipahami sebagai bagian dari tazkiyatun nufus—proses perbaikan diri melalui kesadaran dan ketaatan terhadap kehendak Allah.",
