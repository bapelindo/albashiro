Anxiety disorders are serious mental illnesses that cause significant worry or fear that doesn't go away and may even get worse over time. We all feel anxious at times, but with an anxiety disorder, the anxiety tends to be fairly constant and has a very negative and intrusive impact on quality of life. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), approximately 19.1% of adults in the United States have some type of anxiety disorder. Women are also more likely to be affected by anxiety, which is why experts now recommend that women and girls over the age of 13 should be screened for anxiety disorders as part of routine medical care. There are several types of anxiety disorders. While all are characterized by symptoms of anxiety, each has its own unique set of characteristics, symptoms, and criteria for diagnosis. Agoraphobia is an irrational and extreme fear of being in a situation where escape is impossible. People often fear that they will experience symptoms of panic or other symptoms in public, which leads them to avoid any situation where they may feel panicked, helpless, or trapped. These avoidance behaviors are often life-limiting, often causing people to avoid driving, shopping in public, air travel, or other situations. In some cases, this fear can become so severe that people are unable to leave their homes. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) involves excessive worry and anxiety related to various activities and events. This worry is difficult to control and often shifts from one concern to another. While there is no specific threat, people with GAD find themselves feeling anxious about everyday daily events, current events in the news, relationships, or potential events that might occur. Panic disorder involves experiencing intense and persistent panic attacks that occur unexpectedly with little or no warning. A panic attack has physical and emotional symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, increased respiration, and feelings of extreme terror. Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder that occurs during childhood. It involves experiencing anxiety, embarrassment, or fear that prevents children from speaking in specific settings, such as while at school or around strangers. Selective mutism usually occurs between the ages of two and four and is often accompanied by fidgeting, lack of eye contact, and lack of expressions when faced with a situation the child fears. Social anxiety disorder (SAD), previously known as social phobia, involves a fear of social situations. This fear may center on specific events, such as public speaking, or may involve a more generalized fear of many different social situations. People who have this condition have an exaggerated sense that other people scrutinize everything they do. They may be very critical of themselves and experience both physical and emotional symptoms of fear in social situations. Such symptoms include shaking, racing heartbeat, stomach upset, and dread. These symptoms often lead people to avoid social situations whenever possible. Specific phobias involve intense fear of a specific object or situation that is overwhelming, irrational, and out of proportion to the actual threat. When they encounter the source of their fear, people with a specific phobia experience immediate symptoms such as sweating, crying, shaking, rapid heartbeat, and increased respiration. As often happens with other anxiety disorders, people with a phobia may go to great lengths to avoid the source of their fear. Such avoidance behaviors can cause additional stress and limit daily activities. The fifth edition of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-5), which healthcare providers use to diagnose mental health conditions, breaks what have generally been considered anxiety disorders into three categories: This differ...",
  "summary": "Anxiety disorders adalah gangguan mental serius yang menyebabkan kecemasan atau rasa takut yang tidak perlahan dan dapat memperparah seiring waktu. Meskipun semua orang pernah merasa cemas, pada gangguan kecemasan, rasa cemas menjadi konstan dan sangat mengganggu kualitas hidup. Menurut National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), sekitar 19,1% orang dewasa di Amerika Serikat mengalami gangguan kecemasan. Perempuan lebih rentan terkena gangguan ini, sehingga ahli kesehatan menyarankan agar perempuan dan anak perempuan di usia 13 tahun ke atas harus dilakukan pemeriksaan rutin terkait kecemasan. Ada beberapa jenis gangguan kecemasan. Agorafobia adalah kecemasan ekstrem dan tidak masuk akal terhadap situasi di mana seseorang merasa tidak bisa melarikan diri, seperti merasa mengalami serangan panik atau kehilangan kendali, sehingga mereka menghindari tempat umum seperti berbelanja, berkendara, atau perjalanan udara. Gangguan kecemasan umum (GAD) melibatkan kecemasan berlebihan terhadap berbagai aktivitas dan kejadian, yang sulit dikontrol dan beralih dari satu kekhawatiran ke lainnya, tanpa adanya ancaman spesifik. Gangguan kecemasan panik melibatkan serangan panik yang intens dan tiba-tiba, tanpa peringatan. Kecemasan ini dapat mengganggu fungsi sehari-hari dan memengaruhi kesejahteraan mental secara signifikan. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemahaman terhadap kecemasan harus dibarengi dengan pendekatan spiritual seperti tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa), memperkuat iman, dan memelihara ketenangan batin melalui ibadah dan refleksi. Penanganan yang komprehensif meliputi terapi, pengobatan, dan dukungan sosial.",
