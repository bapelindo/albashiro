  "content": "If you’re thinking about suicide, your pain may seem overwhelming and permanent. But there are ways to cope with suicidal thoughts and feelings and overcome the pain. In the US: 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or IMAlive at 1-800-784-2433. In the UK and Ireland: Call Samaritans UK at 116 123. In Australia: Call Lifeline Australia at 13 11 14. In Canada: Call Crisis Services Canada at 1-833-456-4566. In other countries: Find a helpline near you at Befrienders Worldwide, IASP, or International Suicide Hotlines. No matter how much pain you’re experiencing right now, you’re not alone. Many of us have had suicidal thoughts at some point in our lives. Feeling suicidal is not a character defect, and it doesn’t mean that you are crazy, or weak, or flawed. It only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now. But with time and support, you can overcome your problems and the pain and suicidal feelings will pass. Some of the finest, most admired, needed, and talented people have been where you are now. Many of us have thought about taking our own lives when we’ve felt overwhelmed by depression and devoid of all hope. But the pain of depression can be treated and hope can be renewed. No matter what your situation, there are people who need you, places where you can make a difference, and experiences that can remind you that life is worth living. It takes real courage to face death and step back from the brink. You can use that courage to face life, to learn coping skills for overcoming depression, and for finding the strength to keep going. Remember: Suicidal ideation is a more clinical term for suicidal thoughts. The thoughts you have can vary in intensity. For instance, you might occasionally have passive suicidal thoughts, such as, “I’d be better off dead.” Or you might experience more active suicidal ideation, such as weighing different ways to end your life or coming up with a detailed plan. These thoughts can be early warning signs that eventually lead to behaviors like self-harm and suicide attempts. Many kinds of emotional pain can lead to thoughts of suicide. The reasons for this pain are unique to each one of us, and the ability to cope with the pain differs from person to person. We are all different. There are, however, some common causes that may lead us to experience suicidal thoughts and feelings. If you are unable to think of solutions other than suicide, it is not that other solutions don’t exist, but rather that you are currently unable to see them. The intense emotional pain that you’re experiencing right now can distort your thinking so it becomes harder to see possible solutions to problems—or to connect with those who can offer support. Therapists, counselors, friends, or loved ones can help you see solutions that otherwise may not be apparent to you. Please give them a chance to help. Although it might seem as if your pain and unhappiness will never end, it is important to realize that crises are usually temporary. Solutions are often found, feelings change, unexpected positive events occur. Remember: suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Give yourself the time necessary for things to change and the pain to subside. Mental health conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder are all treatable with changes in lifestyle, therapy, and medication prescribed by a psychiatrist or other medical doctor. Most people who seek help can improve their situation and recover. Even if you have received treatment for a disorder before, or if you’ve already made attempts to solve your problems, know that it’s often necessary to try different approaches before finding the right solution or combination of solutions. When medication is prescribed, for example, finding the right dosage often requires an ongoing process of adjustment. Don’t give up before you’ve found the solution that works for you.

  "summary": "Menghadapi pikiran bunuh diri memang sangat menyakitkan, tetapi ada cara untuk mengatasi hal ini. Perasaan kesakitan dan kehilangan harapan tidak berarti Anda cacat, lemah, atau keliru. Hanya berarti Anda sedang menghadapi rasa sakit yang terlalu berat untuk ditangani saat ini. Penting untuk memahami bahwa pikiran bunuh diri (suicidal ideation) adalah bentuk perasaan yang bisa muncul dengan intensitas berbeda—dari pikiran pasif seperti \"saya lebih baik mati,\" hingga rencana aktif yang lebih detail. Hal ini bisa menjadi peringatan awal dari keadaan psikologis yang membutuhkan perhatian. Anda tidak sendirian. Banyak orang pernah mengalami hal serupa. Dengan dukungan dan waktu, perasaan ini bisa berlalu. Ada banyak orang yang membutuhkan Anda, tempat Anda bisa berkontribusi, dan pengalaman yang bisa membangkitkan harapan bahwa hidup layak dijalani. Menghadapi kenyataan bahwa kehidupan masih berjalan memerlukan keberanian nyata. Keberanian itu bisa digunakan untuk memulai perjalanan memulihkan diri, belajar keterampilan mengatasi depresi, dan menemukan kekuatan untuk melanjutkan hidup. Jangan ragu untuk mencari bantuan profesional atau menghubungi layanan darurat seperti 988 (AS), 116 123 (Inggris), 13 11 14 (Australia), atau layanan lainnya di seluruh dunia. Dengan dukungan, terapi, dan kesadaran, Anda bisa menemukan harapan kembali dan membangun kehidupan yang lebih bermakna.",
