At least one third of people with schizophrenia experiences complete remission of symptoms (1). Some people with schizophrenia experience worsening and remission of symptoms periodically throughout their lives, others a gradual worsening of symptoms over time. Schizophrenia affects approximately 23 million people or 1 in 345 people (0.29%) worldwide. The rate is 1 in 233 people (0.43%) among adults (2). It is not as common as many other mental disorders. Onset is most often during late adolescence and the twenties, and onset tends to happen earlier among men than among women. Schizophrenia is frequently associated with significant distress and impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, and other important areas of life. People with schizophrenia die nine years earlier than the general population (3). This is often due to physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases. People with schizophrenia often experience human rights violations both inside mental health institutions and in community settings. Stigma against people with this condition is intense and widespread, causing social exclusion, and impacting their relationships with others, including family and friends. This contributes to discrimination, which in turn can limit access to general health care, education, housing, and employment. During humanitarian and public health emergencies, extreme stress and fear, breakdown of social supports, isolation and disruption of health-care services and supply of medication can occur. These changes can have an impact on the lives of people with schizophrenia, such as exacerbation of existing symptoms. During emergencies, people with schizophrenia are more vulnerable than others to various human rights violations, including neglect, abandonment, homelessness, abuse and exclusion. Research has not identified one single cause of schizophrenia. It is thought that an interaction between genes and a range of environmental factors may cause schizophrenia.  Psychosocial factors may also affect the onset and course of schizophrenia. Heavy use of cannabis is associated with an elevated risk of the disorder. Currently, the vast majority of people with schizophrenia around the world are not receiving mental health care. Approximately 50% of people in mental hospitals have a schizophrenia diagnosis (4). Only 29% of people with psychosis receive specialist mental health care (5). Most resources for mental health services are inefficiently spent on care within mental hospitals. There is clear evidence that mental hospitals are not effective in providing the care that people with mental health conditions need and, regularly, violate the basic human rights of persons with schizophrenia. Efforts to transfer care from mental health institutions to the community need to be expanded and accelerated. Such efforts start with the development of a range of quality community-based mental health services. Options for community-based mental health care include integration in primary health and general hospital care, community mental health centres, day centres, supported housing, and outreach services for home-based support. The engagement of the person with schizophrenia, family members and the wider community in providing support is important. A range of effective care options for people with schizophrenia exist, and these include medication, psychoeducation, family interventions, cognitive-behavioural therapy and psychosocial rehabilitation (e.g. life skills training). Facilitated assisted living, supported housing and supported employment are essential care options ...",
  "summary": "Schizophrenia adalah gangguan psikologis yang menyebabkan gangguan persepsi terhadap realitas dan perubahan perilaku, disertai kesulitan dalam kemampuan kognitif seperti memori, perhatian, dan pemecahan masalah. Sekitar 1 dari 3 orang mengalami remisi penuh dari gejala, sementara beberapa mengalami fluktuasi gejala secara periodik, sedangkan lainnya mengalami perburukan secara bertahap. Gangguan ini memengaruhi sekitar 23 juta orang atau 1 dari 345 orang secara global, dengan prevalensi 1 dari 233 orang pada dewasa. Onset biasanya terjadi di akhir masa remaja hingga usia 20-an, lebih dini pada pria dibandingkan perempuan. Orang dengan schizophrenia sering mengalami gangguan psikologis yang menyebabkan ketidakmampuan dalam aspek pribadi, keluarga, sosial, pendidikan, dan pekerjaan. Mereka cenderung meninggal sepuluh tahun lebih awal dibandingkan populasi umum, terkait dengan penyakit fisik seperti penyakit jantung, metabolik, dan infeksi. Stigma sosial yang kuat terhadap orang dengan schizophrenia menyebabkan diskriminasi, eksklusi sosial, dan kesulitan dalam akses terhadap layanan kesehatan, pendidikan, perumahan, dan pekerjaan. Selama bencana atau keadaan darurat, stres, isolasi, dan gangguan layanan kesehatan dapat memperparah gejala. Dalam konteks Islam, pemahaman tentang kesehatan mental perlu diperkuat melalui pendekatan tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan jiwa—dengan memperkuat akidah, kebaikan, dan kehidupan bermasyarakat yang sehat. Dengan memperhatikan aspek spiritual dan sosial, orang dengan schizophrenia dapat diberi dukungan yang lebih komprehensif dan manusiawi.",
