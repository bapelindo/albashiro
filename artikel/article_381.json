  "content": "Kendra Cherry, MS, is a psychosocial rehabilitation specialist, psychology educator, and author of the \"Everything Psychology Book.\" Ivy Kwong, LMFT, is a psychotherapist specializing in relationships, love and intimacy, trauma and codependency, and AAPI mental health. Rehab is frequently most associated with drug and alcohol treatment, but it is also a treatment option for people with depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. Rehab can provide a safe place for people who might need extra support, care, and structure while they receive treatment for their condition. Depression rehab typically includes both individual and group therapy, as well as medication management. This type of care can help people who are struggling with depression to learn how to cope with their symptoms, manage their medications, and develop healthy coping mechanisms. Inpatient care can also provide structure and support that benefit people struggling with depression. This article discusses why rehab might be a helpful option for people struggling with clinical depression. It also covers some of the reasons why someone might opt for rehab versus outpatient therapy. When people are dealing with a mental health condition such as depression, the approach to treatment that is right for them often depends on the level of care and support that they need. The lowest level of treatment is outpatient therapy, which involves meeting with a therapist one or more times each week. It may also involve the use of medications such as antidepressants. This is an appropriate and effective option for many people, particularly those with mild to moderate depression. Rehab for depression, on the other hand, represents a higher level of care that may be appropriate for a person experiencing more severe symptoms. Rehab often involves inpatient care in a hospital setting but could also involve partial hospitalization or living in a residential care setting for a period of time. This level of care provides access to mental health services, medical care, supervision, and emotional support. There are several situations where rehab services can be the right choice for treating depression. Inpatient care may be recommended if a person is experiencing suicidality, catatonia, malnutrition, or a comorbid medical condition that makes managing their symptoms in outpatient settings challenging. Rehab may be a preferred choice if a person has a history of attempts or thoughts of self-harm or suicide. If the risk is imminent, however, a person may be hospitalized until their condition has stabilized enough to go to a rehab facility. Once stabilized, a rehab center for depression is a supportive place where they can receive help and learn how to process and cope with challenging situations, emotions, thoughts, and impulses. If someone is feeling suicidal, it's important to get them to a safe place where they can be monitored and get the help they need. If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. For some people, outpatient therapy isn't enough. If traditional therapy and medication aren't working, inpatient care might be a better option. This type of care can provide a higher level of support and supervision. A person's needs can also change over the course of treatment. Research suggests that progress should be monitored during treatment so that an individual’s treatment plan can be adjusted to accommodate their needs. If a person is not experiencing adequate improvements with outpatient therapy they may decide to switch to a rehab or inpatient option. Depression rehab can provide the emotional support and daily structure that some people need while they deal with symptoms of depression and work toward recovery. This treatme...",
  "summary": "Rehabilitasi dapat menjadi pilihan perawatan yang efektif bagi orang yang mengalami depresi, terutama jika gejalanya berat. Meskipun rehabilitasi sering dikaitkan dengan pengobatan untuk gangguan zat, ia juga dapat digunakan untuk mengatasi depresi, kecemasan, dan kondisi mental lainnya. Rehab memasukkan terapi individu dan kelompok, serta pengelolaan obat, untuk membantu pasien memahami gejala, mengelola obat, dan mengembangkan mekanisme penanganan yang sehat. Pemulihan di lingkungan inap memberikan struktur, dukungan, dan lingkungan aman yang sangat dibutuhkan oleh mereka yang mengalami depresi parah. Perbedaan utama antara rehabilitasi dan terapi keluar rumah terletak pada tingkat kebutuhan akan perawatan dan dukungan. Terapi keluar rumah, seperti pertemuan rutin dengan psikolog, cocok untuk kasus depresi ringan hingga sedang. Namun, bagi pasien dengan gejala berat, rehabilitasi—dalam bentuk perawatan inap, perawatan paruh waktu, atau penginapan—memberikan dukungan lebih intensif. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, konsep *tazkiyatun nufus* (perbaikan jiwa) juga relevan, karena menekankan pentingnya keseimbangan antara fisik, mental, dan spiritual. Rehab tidak hanya memperbaiki kondisi mental, tetapi juga membantu membangun kepercayaan diri dan kembali ke kehidupan yang sehat secara keseluruhan. Pilihan perawatan harus disesuaikan dengan kebutuhan individu, dan rehabilitasi bisa menjadi langkah penting bagi mereka yang membutuhkan lingkungan yang terstruktur dan dukungan intensif.",
