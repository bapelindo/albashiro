Strictly speaking, suicidal ideation refers to thoughts (ideating) of suicide or taking your own life. However, there are two kinds of suicidal ideation: passive and active. Passive suicidal ideation occurs when you wish you were dead or that you could die, but you do not formulate a plan to die by suicide. Active suicidal ideation, on the other hand, is not only thinking about it but having the intent to die by suicide, including planning how to do it. \"There’s an urgent need to address suicide from young to old populations. According to the CDC, in 2021, at least 20% of high school students seriously considered attempting suicide,” says Hilary Blumberg, MD, the John and Hope Furth Professor of Psychiatric Neuroscience and Professor of Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine. Suicidal ideation is one of the symptoms of both major depression and the depression found in bipolar disorder, but it may also occur in people with other mental illnesses or no mental illness at all. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation for the general world population is about 9% and about 2% within a 12-month period.﻿﻿ According to the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 4.3% of U.S. adults ages 18 and older had thoughts about suicide, with the highest prevalence among adults ages 18 to 25.﻿﻿ For people with mental health disorders, the rate is significantly higher. The exact numbers are unclear, but since suicidal ideation is a symptom of mental health disorders like major depression and bipolar disorder, the problem exists at a far greater percentage in these populations. Suicide is on the rise, with half of the states in the United States reporting more than a 30% increase since 1999 and nearly all the rest reporting increased rates since then, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States and the second leading cause of death among 10- to 34-year-olds. Women attempt suicide more often than men, but men are successful about three to four times more often than women. Warning signs that you or a loved one are thinking about or contemplating suicide include: If you think a loved one is thinking about or planning suicide, ask. It's a myth that you'll give another person the idea to kill themselves. Asking shows that you're concerned and that you care about the person. Be aware that passive suicidal ideation, wishing that you could die in your sleep or in an accident rather than by your own hand, is not necessarily any less serious than active suicidal ideation. It can quickly turn active and it most certainly has a blend of active and passive components. It's also important to note that suicidal thoughts fluctuate. They are known to \"wax and wane,\" which means that thoughts may be specific, intense, and persistent one day, and the next, they may be more vague and occur less frequently. However, it's always important to take thoughts about suicide seriously and seek help—even if they seem like they've improved. If your loved one admits that they are thinking about suicide, do your best to make sure they are safe. Be there for them if and when they need you. ...",
  "summary": "Pemahaman terhadap ide bunuh diri memerlukan perhatian khusus, karena terdapat dua jenis: ide pasif dan aktif. Ide pasif adalah keinginan untuk mati, tanpa rencana konkret untuk bunuh diri, sementara ide aktif melibatkan niat untuk mengakhiri hidup dengan rencana atau perencanaan cara melakukannya. Menurut data CDC, setidaknya 20% siswa SMA pernah mempertimbangkan mencoba bunuh diri. Ide bunuh diri merupakan gejala dari depresi berat maupun gangguan bipolar, namun juga bisa muncul pada individu tanpa gangguan mental. Prevalensi ide bunuh diri dalam populasi umum sekitar 9% sepanjang hidup, dan 2% dalam satu tahun terakhir. Menurut survei Nasional Pengguna Obat dan Kesehatan Mental (NSDUH) tahun 2017, 4,3% orang dewasa usia 18 tahun ke atas di AS mengalami ide bunuh diri. Kondisi ini perlu ditangani secara serius, terutama pada kelompok muda hingga lanjut usia. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemahaman akan ide bunuh diri harus dibarengi dengan pendekatan spiritual seperti tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa), memperkuat kepercayaan diri, dan memperkuat ikatan dengan Allah. Kebiasaan berdoa, membaca al-Qur'an, dan memperkuat hubungan sosial dapat membantu mencegah kecemasan dan depresi. Jika seseorang mengalami ide bunuh diri, penting untuk segera mencari bantuan profesional. Jangan menunda, hubungi layanan penanganan bunuh diri seperti nomor 988 atau 911 jika dalam bahaya. Dengan pendekatan kesehatan mental dan spiritual yang seimbang, seseorang dapat mengatasi ide tersebut dan membangun kekuatan mental.",
