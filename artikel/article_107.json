Bipolar disorder isn't just about having mood swings. It's a serious mental health condition that used to be referred to as manic depression. There are two main types of bipolar disorder that differ in terms of severity, duration, and nature of their symptoms. This article discusses the symptoms of bipolar disorder, including symptoms of both mania and depression. It also covers potential complications that may occur. Information presented in this article may be triggering for some people. If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. People with bipolar disorder experience dramatic shifts in mood that may include periods of depression and mania. The nature and severity of these symptoms depend on the type of bipolar disorder that they have. Symptoms of a manic or hypomanic episode include: Manic episodes must last at least seven days to meet the criteria for bipolar I disorder and can last much longer. Hypomanic episodes involve the same symptoms, but the individual's functioning isn't markedly impaired, and there are no psychotic symptoms. During a depressive episode, an individual may experience the following symptoms: Problems with cognitive skills, such as subjective memory trouble, difficulty concentrating, and indecision, can be the first things noticed by others when someone has bipolar depression. Cognitive difficulties can interfere with an individual's thinking and make hard for them to complete tasks. During depressive episodes, individuals may experience a variety of physical symptoms, including unexplained aches and pains. Changes in weight are also common. While some people struggle to eat when they're feeling down, others turn to food for comfort. Thus, both weight loss and weight gain can be symptoms of a depressive episode. Psychomotor agitation, an increase in activity caused by mental rather than physical tension, or psychomotor retardation, slowing of both thought and physical activities, may also occur. While less common, people may sometimes experience a mood disorder known as cyclothymia. This condition causes mood changes that are not as severe as those in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Cyclothymia often emerges in adolescence. In many cases, it can be a precursor to bipolar I or II disorder. There are two primary types of bipolar disorder, which are different in terms of how symptoms present and their severity. Bipolar I involves having manic episodes marked by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, excessive energy, decreased need for sleep, and elevated moods. Bipolar II causes depressive episodes and hypomania, which is a less severe form of mania. Bipolar disorder can lead to complications in a person's life. It can also present differently in certain groups. There is no cure for bipolar disorder, but the symptoms can be managed effectively with appropriate treatment. Some potential complications that can occur if the condition is not treated include: Bipolar disorder occurs in men and women at approximately the same rates. However, the presentation of symptoms and course of the condition may differ depending on the sex an individual was assigned at birth. Men are often diagnosed at an earlier age, experience more severe episodes, and are more likely to have co-occurring substance use issues. Women tend to have more depressive episodes and more rapid cycling between manic and depressive episodes. Note that symptoms of bipolar disorder are the same in women and men, but societal and gender roles can affect how they manifest or how others perceive them. While ...",
  "summary": "Disorder bipolar tidak hanya berupa perubahan suasana hati, melainkan kondisi kesehatan mental serius yang dulu dikenal sebagai manik depresi. Ada dua jenis utama bipolar: jenis I dan jenis II, yang dibedakan berdasarkan keparahan, durasi, dan pola gejala. Gejala mania mencakup perubahan mood ekstrem, energi tinggi, keinginan beraktivitas berlebihan, dan kesulitan fokus, dengan durasi minimal tujuh hari untuk diagnosis bipolar I. Hipomania memiliki gejala serupa, tetapi tidak menyebabkan gangguan fungsi sehari-hari dan tidak disertai gejala psikotik. Gejala depresi meliputi kesulitan kognitif seperti kesulitan memori, permasalahan fokus, dan kebingungan, yang sering menjadi perhatian orang lain. Gejala fisik seperti nyeri tidak diketahui dan perubahan berat badan juga muncul. Perubahan ini dapat mengganggu fungsi sehari-hari dan aktivitas individu. Kondisi ini dapat menyebabkan komplikasi serius, termasuk risiko bunuh diri. Artikel ini menekankan pentingnya pengenalan gejala dan perawatan profesional. Jika seseorang mengalami pikiran bunuh diri, segera hubungi layanan bantuan seperti nomor 988 atau 911 jika dalam bahaya. Artikel ini mungkin memicu perasaan tidak nyaman bagi beberapa orang. Untuk informasi lebih lanjut dan sumber daya kesehatan mental, dapat dilihat di database layanan nasional. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemahaman tentang kesehatan mental dapat diperkuat melalui prinsip tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan jiwa—dengan memperkuat akidah, kebaikan, dan keseimbangan emosi, sesuai dengan ajaran Islam yang menekankan kestabilan rohani dan kesehatan mental.",
