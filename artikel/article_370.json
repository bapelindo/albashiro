Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Knowing what to say to someone who is depressed isn't always easy. Try not to be dissuaded by worry over saying the \"wrong\" thing. Too many people with clinical depression feel alone—a state that only worsens their condition. If you don't know what to say, just say that—and tell your friend that you are there for them. Keep reading to learn what you can do when you want to say more but have a hard time expressing what you feel. We also provide a few statements that someone with depression might find helpful to hear. These two simple words—\"I care\"—can mean so much to a person who may be feeling like the entire world is against them. A hug or a gentle touch of the hand can even get this message across. The important thing is to reach out and let the person know that they matter to you. While you may feel awkward and unsure at first, know that whatever you say doesn't have to be profound or poetic. It should simply be something that comes from a place of compassion and acceptance. Someone with depression can feel as though no one understands what they are feeling or even cares enough to try to understand. This can be isolating and overwhelming. Research has shown that people tend to withdraw socially when they are depressed. So, reaching out to a friend in need is an important first step. If your friend isn't ready to talk, continue to offer your support by spending time with them and try to check in regularly either in person, on the phone, or by text. When you reach out to a friend, letting them know that you will be there every step of the way can be very reassuring. You may not quite know what this will look like at first, but just reminding your friend that you are someone they can lean on can mean the world. Depression places a great weight on the person who is experiencing it, both physically and mentally. As a result, there are many things you can do to ease its effects as your friend recovers. They may be reluctant to accept your offer for fear of becoming a burden on you. So, make it clear that you don't mind and want to help in the same way you know they would for you. It is also possible that depression may leave your friend so tired and down that they don't know what kind of help to ask for. Be prepared with a few specific suggestions, which may include: Being specific in regards to both the time and the activity can be helpful. For example, instead of saying \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" perhaps ask, \"Could I come over on Saturday morning and do some yard work for you?\" Remember, too, that the help you think your friend may need may not match with what would actually be beneficial in their eyes. Suggest—and listen. Depression can make daily tasks and other obligations much more difficult. Lending tangible, practical support can be a great way to help someone who is depressed. Depression treatments are a very important part of recovering from depression. But people often feel ashamed of their condition or pessimistic about whether treatment will really help. If your friend has not yet seen a healthcare provider, encourage them to seek help and reassure them that there is nothing wrong with asking for assistance. Depression is a real—and treatable—illness. If your friend is already seeing a healthcare provider, offer to help with picking up medications and being on time for appointments.

  "summary": "Ketika seseorang mengalami depresi, penting untuk menyampaikan dukungan dengan tulus dan empati. Banyak orang dengan depresi merasa sendirian dan tidak dipahami, yang memperparah kondisi mereka. Jadi, lebih baik menghindari kata-kata yang terlalu kompleks atau \"tepat\" karena kebutuhan utama adalah perasaan bahwa mereka dicintai dan dihargai. Dua kata sederhana seperti \"Aku peduli\" bisa sangat bermakna bagi seseorang yang merasa terpencil dari dunia. Sebuah pelukan atau sentuhan lembut tangan juga bisa menyampaikan rasa peduli tanpa perlu kata-kata. Kuncinya adalah menunjukkan bahwa orang tersebut penting dan dihargai. Bahkan jika tidak tahu apa yang harus dikatakan, kehadiran dan kesediaan untuk mendengarkan cukup untuk memberi harapan. Orang dengan depresi cenderung menarik diri secara sosial, sehingga dukungan dari teman atau keluarga sangat penting. Jika teman tidak siap berbicara, tetap berikan dukungan dengan menghadiri mereka secara rutin—dengan bertemu, menelepon, atau mengirim pesan. Menunjukkan bahwa Anda akan selalu ada untuk mereka dapat memberikan keamanan emosional. Dalam psikologi Islam, konsep *tazkiyatun nufus* (perbaikan jiwa) menekankan pentingnya kepedulian, keikhlasan, dan keberadaan dalam menghadapi kesulitan. Dukungan emosional bukan hanya soal kata, tapi juga tentang kehadiran yang penuh kasih. Dengan memperlihatkan rasa peduli, kita membantu membangun kepercayaan diri dan harapan pada diri sendiri. Dukungan ini menjadi bagian dari perawatan mental yang seimbang dan berakar pada nilai-nilai kepedulian dan kasih sayang.",
