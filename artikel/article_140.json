Either way, I want to start with a simple, heartfelt disclaimer. You’re free to disagree with me, and I won’t take it personally. You may decide not to follow my work after this, and that’s perfectly okay. But if you’ve ever felt that therapy didn’t quite get you, or if you’ve had questions about healing that seemed to go deeper than cognitive distortions and childhood scripts, then stay with me. Read this piece with an open heart. That’s all I ask. Also, let me be clear: I am not a therapist. I’m a Certified Life Coach who thinks deeply, reflects often, and reads widely. I know depression, anxiety, and emotional pain are real and debilitating. If you need professional help, please do seek it. What follows is simply my perspective, shaped by experience, faith, and research. Bismillah. A conventional therapy engagement usually starts with a few sessions where the therapist gets to know you, your story, your struggles, and what you hope to achieve. You meet weekly, often for 45 to 60 minutes, and talk about your thoughts and feelings. Many therapists use models like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), which aims to reframe negative thinking, or Psychodynamic Therapy, which dives into your childhood and unconscious motivations. Over time, if you’re doing “better,” the sessions taper off. That’s therapy, in a nutshell. I want to be fair here: millions have found relief, tools, and emotional safety in therapy, and I respect that. But what if I told you that conventional therapy, as widely practised today, has serious limitations? What if I told you it was incomplete? One of the most influential names in the mental health field is Dr. Gabor Maté. I have learned a lot from him, and I genuinely respect his work. According to Maté, trauma isn’t just what happened to you—it’s what happened inside you because of what happened to you. That’s a powerful lens. But in many therapy spaces today, trauma begins to take centre stage. You tell your story. Then you retell it. Then you dig deeper into it. You sit with it. Your trauma becomes almost sacred, like a badge of honour. The therapist listens kindly, gently, offering insight and compassion. But here’s a question: if the human brain forgets 95% of an actual memory (as shown in the research of Dr. Joe Dispenza), how much of our richly detailed storytelling is actually accurate? How much of it is shaped by our present emotions, our therapist’s responses, and our own evolving narrative? And what happens when we keep looping the same story? We rehearse the pain. The neural pathways grow stronger. We begin to see the world through a lens of “what was done to me.” We might feel like survivors, but often, we remain emotionally stuck, dependent on someone else to help us “process” every new trigger. Here’s where it gets uncomfortable. Many people begin to rely on their therapist as the only person who really “gets” them. Real relationships start to feel exhausting because, let’s face it, not everyone in your life is a trained therapist with endless patience and validation techniques. And if your therapist ever gently suggests, “Maybe this was partly your fault,” you might feel invalidated—or worse, you might leave. So often, therapists avoid pushing too hard. They listen. Nod. Validate. And while that feels safe, does it always lead to real growth? What if real healing actually lies in reconnecting with others instead of becoming increasingly isolated? What if it lies not in endlessly analysing the wound, but in rising from it with grace? Today, everything seems to be about trauma. You yelled at your sibling? Must be childhood trauma. You ghosted a friend? Emotional neglect, of course. Everything is explainable. Everything is justifiable. But here’s the danger: when we glorify trauma, ...",
  "summary": "Terapi konvensional sering kali gagal dalam menangani masalah emosional mendalam karena hanya fokus pada pola pikir atau masa kecil, tanpa menangani aspek spiritual dan emosional yang lebih dalam. Penulis menyatakan bahwa terapi tradisional, meski efektif bagi banyak orang, memiliki keterbatasan—terutama dalam menangani trauma yang berakar pada pengalaman batin dan kebutuhan batin. Menurut Dr. Gabor Maté, trauma bukan hanya peristiwa yang dialami, tetapi juga dampaknya pada psikologi dan jiwa secara batin. Terapi klasik seperti CBT atau terapi psidinamik sering kali hanya mengubah pola pikir, namun tidak menyentuh akar masalah seperti kebutuhan akan kasih sayang, rasa aman, atau keseimbangan batin. Penulis, seorang pelatih kehidupan, menekankan bahwa kebutuhan akan pemulihan tidak hanya terletak pada perubahan pikiran, tetapi juga pada keseimbangan spiritual dan koneksi dengan diri sendiri. Dalam konteks Islam, konsep *tazkiyatun nufus* (perbaikan jiwa) menjadi penting—mengajarkan manusia untuk memperbaiki diri secara batin, melalui keimanan, refleksi, dan keberanian menghadapi kebenaran diri. Oleh karena itu, terapi yang benar-benar menyentuh akar masalah harus mencakup aspek spiritual, emosional, dan keberlanjutan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Penulis menekankan bahwa jika terapi tidak memberikan perubahan mendalam, mungkin perlu pendekatan yang lebih holistik dan berakar pada nilai-nilai spiritual.",
