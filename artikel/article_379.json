Carly Snyder, MD is a reproductive and perinatal psychiatrist who combines traditional psychiatry with integrative medicine-based treatments. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a type of depression that occurs after giving birth. It’s more serious than the “baby blues” as it can interfere with a new mother’s ability to function. It’s important for new mothers and family members to be on the lookout for signs of postpartum depression. It’s treatable and early intervention can be key to helping mothers feel better as quickly as possible. It’s completely normal for new moms to feel tired, moody, or overwhelmed after giving birth. But when these symptoms interfere with a new mother’s ability to function and care for their new child, it can be a sign of postpartum depression. Symptoms of PPD vary from person to person. And they may fluctuate on a daily basis. In general, here are some symptoms that mothers with this condition experience: Symptoms typically appear within a few weeks of giving birth, but they may not surface until months later. They sometimes temporarily subside and then resurface. If you or a loved one are struggling with postpartum depression, contact Postpartum Support International at 1-800-944-4773 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. A physician or mental health professional can diagnose PPD. This diagnosis would be made after an interview and assessment. Many physicians routinely ask new mothers questions about whether they’ve had thoughts of hurting themselves or their babies and whether they’re feeling down. This is part of the screening process for postpartum depression. Physicians may run some tests to rule out any health issues that may be contributing to symptoms. Thyroid conditions, for example, can cause depression. Once physical health issues have been ruled out, a diagnosis of postpartum depression might be made if the criteria are met. Treatment for PPD may include medication, therapy, or a combination of both. As of August 4, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Zuranolone as the first oral treatment for postpartum depression. Zuranolone is a once-a-day medication for postpartum depression taken over two weeks. Antidepressants are also commonly prescribed to treat it. These regulate the chemicals in the brain that manage emotions. But it can take a few weeks for them to take effect. And sometimes the first antidepressant doesn’t work, so a new medication may be tried. Some antidepressants are safe to take if you’re breastfeeding, but others are not. Your physician will discuss treatment options with you as well as any side effects you might experience. Your physician may refer you to a therapist as well. A licensed mental health professional can help you find healthy ways to cope with stress as well as strategies for dealing with depression while you’re caring for yourself and your baby. Postpartum depression affects up to 15% of mothers. While all the reasons some mothers develop postpartum depression and others don’t aren’t completely known, recent research has identified several risk factors. Psychosocial risk factors for postpartum depression include: Postpartum depression may be related to sensitivity to hormonal fluctuations. Women who previously had the condition are more likely to experience it again after the birth of another baby. Normal fluctuations in hormonal levels during pregnancy and after delivery can lead to changes in sleep patterns. And these interruptions in sleep can contribute to the onset of postpartum depression. One study f...",
  "summary": "Depresi pasca melahirkan (PPD) adalah kondisi depresi yang muncul setelah melahirkan, lebih serius dari \"baby blues\" karena dapat mengganggu kemampuan ibu untuk berfungsi sehari-hari. Meskipun merasa lelah, emosional, atau terbebani adalah hal normal setelah melahirkan, jika gejala ini menghambat perawatan anak atau fungsi sehari-hari, bisa menandakan PPD. Gejala PPD bervariasi dari orang ke orang dan bisa berubah sepanjang waktu. Biasanya muncul beberapa minggu setelah melahirkan, meskipun bisa muncul hingga beberapa bulan kemudian. Gejala bisa sementara membaik, lalu kembali muncul. PPD harus didiagnosis oleh profesional kesehatan mental melalui wawancara dan evaluasi. Dokter atau profesional kesehatan mental biasanya menanyakan apakah ibu mengalami pikiran untuk membahayakan diri atau bayi, serta perasaan sedih atau tidak sehat. PPD dapat diobati, dan intervensi dini sangat penting untuk mempercepat pemulihan. Ibu dan keluarga perlu waspada terhadap gejala ini. Jika ditemukan, segera mencari bantuan dari Postpartum Support International (1-800-944-4773) atau profesional kesehatan mental. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, PPD juga dapat dipahami melalui prinsip tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan diri, menjaga keseimbangan emosi, dan memperkuat kepercayaan diri. Ibu yang mengalami PPD perlu didukung secara emosional dan spiritual, dengan memperkuat ikatan dengan keluarga, ibadah, dan kepercayaan diri. Dengan pendekatan holistik, ibu dapat pulih secara fisik dan spiritual.",
