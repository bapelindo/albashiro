  "summary": "Disorder mental adalah kondisi yang memengaruhi cara seseorang berpikir, merasakan, dan berperilaku. Ada lebih dari 200 jenis gangguan mental, seperti depresi, kecemasan, dan schizofrenia. Gejala bisa mencakup perubahan suasana hati, perubahan nafsu makan, mimpi atau halusinasi, serta hilangnya minat terhadap aktivitas sehari-hari. Gangguan ini dapat memengaruhi kemampuan seseorang dalam kehidupan rumah, pekerjaan, atau sekolah. Meskipun terjadi pada semua usia, risiko meningkat jika ada riwayat keluarga atau faktor lingkungan seperti stres berkepanjangan. Kondisi ini sangat umum—sekitar 1 dari 8 orang di dunia mengalami gangguan mental. Meskipun seseorang tidak harus mengalami semua gejala untuk didiagnosis, adanya beberapa gejala seperti perubahan emosi atau perilaku bisa menjadi tanda untuk meminta bantuan profesional. Perawatan seperti terapi dan obat-obatan dapat membantu mengelola gejala. Penting untuk memahami bahwa gangguan mental bukan kelemahan, melainkan kondisi medis yang memerlukan perhatian dan intervensi. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, konsep tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) juga relevan, karena menekankan pentingnya memelihara kestabilan emosi, kepercayaan diri, dan keseimbangan hati. Dengan pendekatan yang menyeluruh, baik secara medis maupun spiritual, seseorang dapat memulai perjalanan pemulihan dan kembali merasa sehat secara mental. Bantuan profesional dan kepercayaan diri adalah kunci untuk memulai perbaikan.",
