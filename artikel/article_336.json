  "content": "This book is composed of two sections and nineteen chapters in all. Section 1 encompasses the conceptual and theoretical foundations while Section 2 addresses key issues and problems with marriage and the family. In Africa the complementary institutions of marriage and the family are greatly appreciated. Accordingly, students and scholars in psychology in African universities clamour for texts on marriage and family therapy that give recognition to those African values that have stood the test of time. Given that most of the existing textbooks on marriage and family therapy are authored by our Eurowestern colleagues who know about and foster only the Eurowestern tradition on marriage and family practice, it is considered timely that the present book be produced with the contents and message that could occupy the middle ground of the two traditions: African and Western. The book presents a valuable addition to the existing literature on marriage and family therapy tailored to suit the interests and needs of students and scholars in global Africa and the wider world. Augustine Nwoye is currently Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and a Part-time Professor in the Department of Clinical Psychology at Sefako Makgatho University of Health Sciences, South Africa. He has held distinguished teaching positions in other universities in Africa, including the University of Jos, Nigeria; Kenyatta University, Kenya; the University of Dodoma, Tanzania; and won several Visiting Fellowships and given Public Lectures in many universities in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America, including the University of Cambridge (England); Ohio State, Howard, Temple, and College of the Holy Cross (USA); Toronto and Calgary (Canada); and Stockholm (Sweden). His recent most prestigious publication is entitled African Psychology: The Emergence of a Tradition published in 2022. He has published over fifty learned articles in high impact journals in his specialist field of African Psychology in which he is well known throughout the world. This book explores the human psyche (‘soul’) and its usefulness in a techno-scientific revolution that is often blind to its subject: the human being. It makes a strong intellectual case for the soul by examining consciousness, synchronicity, suffering, and death. This guide provides a clinical and forensic approach to personality disorders, comparing the categorical (ICD-10) and dimensional (ICD-11) classifications. With diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines, it will appeal to psychiatrists, psychologists, and students. A positive link exists between religiosity and well-being. This book brings together in one volume scattered empirical studies on the topic from different Arab, mainly Muslim, countries, exploring the connection to mental health, happiness, and quality of life. Belief in possession has ancient roots. This book traces its global history and explores how mental health professionals can help a person who believes they are possessed. Featuring interviews with exorcists, this is a fascinating study for believers and sceptics alike. Modern challenges cause stress and poor health. This book develops the concept of ‘emotional health’ as a bio-psycho-socio-cultural balance, bridging medical treatments with alternative therapies to highlight new solutions to these problems. This book offers a new perspective on the origins of human sexuality. It reveals that romantic love and exclusive pair-bonds are not our original evolutionary features. Early humans practiced multiple-partner relations until culture restrained their innate sexual nature. Common perspectives on sexual orientation are inaccurate. This book establishes criteria for a robust theory, evaluates major perspectives, and proposes the first novel theory in decades: a four-component approach that explains many fascinating sexual orientation occurrences. This book covers the consequences of death f...",
  "summary": "Buku ini membahas perspektif multikultural terhadap terapi pernikahan dan keluarga, dengan menekankan nilai-nilai tradisional Afrika dalam konteks psikologi pernikahan dan keluarga. Buku ini dibagi menjadi dua bagian: bagian pertama membahas dasar konseptual dan teori, sedangkan bagian kedua membahas isu-isu kunci dalam hubungan pernikahan dan keluarga. Dalam konteks Afrika, institusi pernikahan dan keluarga dihargai sebagai bagian dari kehidupan sosial dan budaya yang kuat. Karena kebanyakan buku terapi keluarga saat ini berasal dari tradisi Eropa-Barat yang tidak mempertimbangkan nilai-nilai lokal, maka buku ini menjadi solusi penting. Penulis, Augustine Nwoye, seorang profesor psikologi dari Afrika Selatan, mengusulkan pendekatan yang seimbang antara tradisi Afrika dan Western, memperkuat nilai-nilai budaya Afrika yang bertahan melalui waktu. Buku ini dirancang khusus untuk mahasiswa dan akademisi di Afrika dan dunia, memberikan wawasan yang lebih komprehensif dan relevan. Nwoye telah mengajar di berbagai universitas di Afrika, Asia, Eropa, dan Amerika, serta telah menerbitkan karya ilmiah yang mendunia, termasuk buku *African Psychology: The Emergence of a Tradition* (2022). Dengan pendekatan yang menghargai keunikan budaya lokal, buku ini tidak hanya memperkuat psikologi Afrika sebagai tradisi yang berkembang, tetapi juga memberikan kontribusi besar terhadap literatur global dalam bidang terapi keluarga.
