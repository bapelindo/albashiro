Tim Robberts Collection / Stone / Getty Images Hallucinations are the perception of a nonexistent object or event and sensory experiences that are not caused by stimulation of the relevant sensory organs. The word \"hallucination\" comes from Latin and means \"to wander mentally.\" In layperson's terms, hallucinations involve hearing, seeing, feeling, smelling, or even tasting things that are not real. Auditory hallucinations, which include hearing voices or other sounds that have no physical source, are the most common type. Hallucinations occur frequently in people with psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; however, you don't necessarily need to have a mental illness to experience hallucinations. No matter what is causing hallucinations, they should be taken seriously. There are five main types of hallucinations, including: There are also other types of hallucinations, including: Some people experience hallucinations at night or in the morning. These types of hallucinations include: A hallucination is when your senses are perceiving something that isn't happening in reality (i.e., you see and hear a person in the room who's not really there). A delusion, on the other hand, is the belief that something is happening, for which there is no evidence (i.e., you believe that the government is controlling you through your TV). Hallucinations can have a range of symptoms, depending on the type, including: After asking about your symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle habits, your healthcare provider will likely do a physical exam and order a few tests to try and rule out medical or neurological causes of your hallucinations. Diagnostic tests may include: Unfortunately, studies show that people underreport hallucinations. When talking to a doctor, it’s important to be honest about the duration and frequency as well as the specific symptoms associated with your hallucinations. Hallucinations are most often associated with schizophrenia, a mental illness characterized by disordered thoughts and behaviors. However, they are also a possible characteristic of bipolar disorder. With bipolar I disorder, hallucinations are possible, both with mania and depression. In bipolar II, hallucinations may occur only during the depressive phase. Bipolar disorder that presents with hallucinations or delusions can also lead to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Not only do hallucinations occur with mental health conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but they can also occur with the following physical and psychological conditions as well: The treatment of hallucinations will depend on the type of hallucination, the underlying cause, and your overall health. In general, however, your doctor will likely recommend a multidisciplinary approach that includes medication, therapy, and social support. Psychotherapy for hallucinations involves engaging the patient to be curious around the details of the symptoms, providing psycho-education, exploring \"plausible reasons\" for the hallucinations and normalizing the experience. The following self-help strategies can help patients cope with auditory hallucinations: Antipsychotic medications often are effective for treating hallucinations, either by eliminating or reducing the frequency with which they occur or by having a calming effect that makes them less distressing. Nuplazid (pimavanserin) is the first drug approved to treat hallucinations associated with Parkinson’s disease. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a relatively non-invasive procedure that involves placing a small magnetic device directly on the skull, has some preliminary evidence that it may be able to reduce the frequency and severity of auditory halluci...",
  "summary": "Halusinasi adalah pengalaman sensorik terhadap objek atau kejadian yang tidak ada secara fisik, tanpa stimulasi organ sensorik yang nyata. Istilah \"halusinasi\" berasal dari Latin yang berarti \"bergerak secara mental.\" Secara sederhana, halusinasi melibatkan perasaan mendengar, melihat, merasakan, mencium, atau mengonsumsi sesuatu yang tidak nyata. Tipe paling umum adalah halusinasi auditori, seperti mendengar suara atau suara orang yang tidak ada. Halusinasi sering muncul pada gangguan psikologis seperti schizofrenia dan gangguan bipolar, namun tidak selalu terkait dengan gangguan mental. Meski demikian, halusinasi perlu dianggap serius karena bisa menjadi tanda kondisi medis atau neurologis. Ada lima jenis utama halusinasi, termasuk halusinasi visual, auditori, olfaktori, gustatif, dan kinestetik. Beberapa halusinasi terjadi di malam hari atau pagi hari. Perbedaan antara halusinasi dan delusi penting: halusinasi adalah pengalaman sensorik nyata (misalnya melihat orang di ruangan), sedangkan delusi adalah kepercayaan terhadap sesuatu yang tidak ada bukti (misalnya percaya pemerintah mengendalikan TV). Gejala halusinasi bervariasi tergantung jenisnya. Untuk mengevaluasi penyebabnya, tenaga kesehatan akan melakukan pemeriksaan fisik dan tes medis atau neurologis. Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa banyak orang menghindari melaporkan halusinasi. Oleh karena itu, penting untuk memperhatikan gejala ini dan meminta bantuan profesional. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, halusinasi bisa dianggap sebagai tantangan dalam tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa), karena memengaruhi kepercayaan dan kesadaran akan kebenaran.",
