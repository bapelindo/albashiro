  "content": "Many people feel extreme fear during or after witnessing or experiencing potentially traumatic events, such as war, accidents, natural disasters or sexual violence. Most people exposed to such events will experience distress but will recover naturally with time. Some people continue to experience a range of mental health conditions that can persist for months or even years, including PTSD, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders. Around 70% of people globally will experience a potentially traumatic event during their lifetime (1), But only a minority (5.6%) will go on to develop PTSD (2). An estimated 3.9% of the world population has experienced PTSD at some point in their lives (2). The likelihood of developing PTSD varies depending on the type of traumatic event experienced. For example, rates of PTSD are more than three times (15.3%) higher among people exposed to violent conflict or war (3). PTSD rates are especially high following sexual violence (1). Up to 40% of people with PTSD recover within one year (1). There are many effective treatments for PTSD, yet only 1 in 4 people with PTSD in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) report seeking any form of treatment (2). Barriers to care include lack of awareness that PTSD can be treated, lack of availability of mental health services, social stigma and lack of trained mental health care providers. Experiencing distress or other mental health difficulties after a potentially traumatic event is common but does not mean someone is experiencing PTSD. Someone experiences PTSD when they have symptoms re-experiencing the event, avoid reminders of the event and experience symptoms of heightened arousal that cause significant distress, and interfere with daily activities and family, social, school or working life. People with PTSD have repeated and unwanted recollections of the traumatic event(s), which make them feel as if the event(s) is happening all over again. These memories are accompanied by intense fear or horror. They may be experienced as images, sounds (e.g. gunfire), smells (e.g. the odour of an assailant) or other sensations. These recollections might occur through intrusive memories, nightmares, or, in severe cases, flashbacks. During flashbacks, the person might momentarily believe and act as if they were back at the time of the event, experiencing it again. People with PTSD avoid situations, activities, thoughts or memories that remind them of the traumatic event(s). They may even avoid talking about the event(s) with their family or health care providers. People usually use these strategies to try to avoid distressing recollections. Yet avoidance strategies may inadvertently intensify re-experiencing symptoms over time and thus perpetuate the presence of PTSD. People with PTSD may experience a heightened sense of danger, even when they are not actually at risk. This can involve them being much more vigilant than usual, for example constantly scanning their surroundings for potential threats or feeling the need to sit with their back against a wall in public places. They may be more easily startled or jumpy, reacting with excessive fear to sudden movements or loud noises. Symptoms of PTSD typically begin immediately after or within one month of a traumatic event. In younger children, symptoms are often behavioural and can include re-enacting the traumatic event during play or in drawings. Children often unjustly blame themselves for what happened. The experience of PTSD can also vary across cultures. For instance, in some cultures, it may be more acceptable to express anger about the event, making this a more prominent experience. In other cultures, people with PTSD may more commonly have physical complaints with unclear causes, such as headaches or gastrointestinal symptoms. People with PTSD may also have depressive disorder, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Many of the ...",
  "summary": "Kecemasan ekstrem saat atau setelah mengalami atau melihat kejadian traumatis seperti perang, kecelakaan, bencana alam, atau kekerasan seksual merupakan respons umum. Sebagian besar orang yang mengalami kejadian traumatis akan merasa terganggu, namun akan memulihkan diri secara alami dengan waktu. Namun, sekitar 5,6% dari mereka mengalami gangguan kecemasan berkepanjangan, yaitu gangguan stres pasca-trauma (PTSD), yang dapat berlangsung hingga bertahun-tahun. Diperkirakan 3,9% populasi dunia pernah mengalami PTSD. Risiko terjadinya PTSD lebih tinggi pada kejadian seperti konflik bersenjata atau kekerasan seksual, dengan angka hingga 15,3%. Sebanyak 40% pasien PTSD dapat memulihkan diri dalam satu tahun. Meskipun ada banyak terapi yang efektif, hanya 1 dari 4 orang dengan PTSD di negara berkembang dan menengah yang mencari perawatan. Hambatan terkait perawatan meliputi kurangnya kesadaran akan keterapi, kurangnya akses layanan kesehatan mental, stigma sosial, dan kekurangan tenaga profesional. PTSD dinyatakan ketika seseorang mengalami gejala mengulang kejadian traumatis, menghindari stimulasi terkait, dan mengalami kecemasan berlebihan yang mengganggu kehidupan sehari-hari. Gejala seperti mimpi, perasaan seperti sedang mengalami kejadian, dan rasa terancam dapat mengganggu aktivitas keluarga, sosial, pendidikan, atau kerja. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemulihan melalui tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) dan ketaatan kepada Allah dapat menjadi bagian dari proses pemulihan, dengan menekankan kekuatan iman, ketenangan rohani, dan kepercayaan pada Allah sebagai penjaga dan penyembuh.",
