Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. People with social anxiety disorder (SAD) experience significant and chronic fear of social or performance-related situations where they might be embarrassed, rejected, or scrutinized. In these situations, people with SAD almost always experience physical anxiety symptoms. Although they know their fear is unreasonable, they can't seem to do anything to stop it, so they either avoid these situations altogether or get through them while feeling intense anxiety and distress. In this way, social anxiety disorder extends beyond everyday shyness and can be extremely impairing. This article explains the common symptoms of social anxiety disorder. It also describes potential complications and how symptoms may present differently in children. We've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, BetterHelp, and ReGain. Find out which option is the best for you. Symptoms of social anxiety disorder typically fall within three different areas. While everyone's experience is different, symptoms of the condition typically result in physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. The physical symptoms of SAD can be extremely distressing. Common physical symptoms include: In some cases, these physical symptoms may become so severe that they escalate into a full-blown panic attack. However, unlike those with panic disorder, people with SAD know that their panic is provoked by fears of social and performance-related situations rather than fears about the panic attacks themselves. Social anxiety disorder also involves cognitive symptoms, which are dysfunctional thought patterns. If you have this condition, you might find that you are bothered by negative thoughts and self-doubt when it comes to social and performance-related situations. Below are some common symptoms that you may experience: For example, imagine you start a new job or arrive on the first day of a new class. The instructor or manager asks everyone to introduce themselves to the group. If you have social anxiety disorder, you may start to have negative thoughts such as, “Everyone else looks so much more relaxed,” “What if I say something dumb?” or “What if everyone notices my voice shaking?” These thoughts start to rapidly spiral out of control to the point that you don't hear anything anyone else has said. When it comes to your turn, you say as little as possible and hope that no one has noticed your anxiety. Negative thought patterns can also erode your self-esteem over time, so it's important to seek treatment. Social anxiety disorder can also cause you to act in certain ways. In many cases, you might find yourself making choices based on fear and avoidance rather than your actual preferences, desires, or ambitions. For example, you may drop a class to avoid doing a presentation or turn down a job promotion because it meant increased social and performance demands. Below are some common behavioral symptoms: Social anxiety disorder can lead to serious complications in your life. It can result in panic attacks, which can be frightening and contribute to increased feelings of fear and avoidance. Avoidance of social situations can make it difficult to maintain interpersonal relationships. This can affect your ability to work, attend school, and participate in other social events. It can contribute to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can have a detrimental impact on your health and well-being. In severe cases, if left untreated, social anxiety disorder can increase your risk of having a poor quality of life. You might have few or no friends and no romantic relationships. It may even lead you to drop out of school or qu...",
  "summary": "Disorder kecemasan sosial (SAD) adalah kondisi kronis yang menimbulkan kecemasan berat terhadap situasi sosial atau pertunjukan di mana seseorang merasa terpantau, ditolak, atau dikritik. Orang dengan SAD mengalami gejala fisik seperti detak jantung cepat, berkeringat, atau perasaan tidak nyaman, yang sering memicu kecemasan intens. Meskipun mereka menyadari bahwa kecemasan ini tidak masuk akal, mereka tidak bisa menghentikannya, sehingga menghindari situasi sosial atau mengalami ketegangan berat saat menghadapinya. Gejala SAD terbagi menjadi tiga kategori: fisik, kognitif, dan perilaku. Gejala kognitif meliputi pola pikir negatif seperti kecemasan akan ditolak atau dihakimi, yang memperparah ketakutan. Gejala perilaku biasanya mencerminkan penundaan atau penghindaran dari kegiatan sosial. Kondisi ini tidak hanya menyerupai kecemasan biasa, tetapi sangat mengganggu kehidupan sehari-hari. Pada anak-anak, gejala SAD mungkin tampak berbeda, seperti kecemasan terhadap sekolah atau berinteraksi dengan teman. Meskipun tidak ada pengobatan alternatif yang disebutkan, terapi kognitif perilaku (CBT) dan pendekatan psikologis berbasis Islam seperti tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) dapat membantu memperbaiki pola pikir dan mengurangi ketegangan. Penanganan SAD memerlukan pendekatan komprehensif, termasuk terapi profesional dan dukungan sosial. Dengan pengenalan gejala dan perawatan yang tepat, individu dapat mengelola kecemasan dan memperbaiki kualitas hidupnya.",
