  "content": "This work develops the concept of ‘emotional health’ as the presence of a bio-psycho-socio-cultural balance. Modern lives contain constant social, political and economic challenges, as well as ecological emergencies. All of these can be causes of stress, leading to poor health and mental illness. This book serves to build the bridge between medical treatments with alternative and complementary medicine, as well as therapies, in order to highlight a bio-psycho-socio-cultural approach which can help us to find new solutions to these health problems. This book introduces the concept of planetary health, develops the concept of ‘bio-psycho-socio-cultural balance’, and defines the concepts which make up this balance. Dr Carol Dillon studied Medicine at the Salvador University, Argentina, and specialized as a Psychiatrist at the Neuropsychiatric Hospital “Dr Braulio Moyano”, Buenos Aires, Argentina (2001-2005). After receiving her PhD in Mental Health Studies from Buenos Aires University, she is now a Professor of Neuroscience at Palermo University, Argentina, and works as a Clinical Researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council. She also performs her clinical practice as a Neuropsychiatrist in the Neurology Section of the Medical Department at CEMIC University Hospital, Argentina, and is an international member of the American Psychiatric Association, as well as the World Federation of Biological Psychiatry. Her research explores depression, degenerative diseases, neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological symptoms, biological psychiatry and neuroscience. This book explores the human psyche (‘soul’) and its usefulness in a techno-scientific revolution that is often blind to its subject: the human being. It makes a strong intellectual case for the soul by examining consciousness, synchronicity, suffering, and death. This guide provides a clinical and forensic approach to personality disorders, comparing the categorical (ICD-10) and dimensional (ICD-11) classifications. With diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines, it will appeal to psychiatrists, psychologists, and students. A positive link exists between religiosity and well-being. This book brings together in one volume scattered empirical studies on the topic from different Arab, mainly Muslim, countries, exploring the connection to mental health, happiness, and quality of life. Belief in possession has ancient roots. This book traces its global history and explores how mental health professionals can help a person who believes they are possessed. Featuring interviews with exorcists, this is a fascinating study for believers and sceptics alike. This book offers a new perspective on the origins of human sexuality. It reveals that romantic love and exclusive pair-bonds are not our original evolutionary features. Early humans practiced multiple-partner relations until culture restrained their innate sexual nature. Common perspectives on sexual orientation are inaccurate. This book establishes criteria for a robust theory, evaluates major perspectives, and proposes the first novel theory in decades: a four-component approach that explains many fascinating sexual orientation occurrences. This book covers the consequences of death for patients and families, including grief and health. It offers a health promotion perspective on palliative care for patients, families, and care workers, stressing the importance of fulfilling patient wishes. How do we make sense of our world, a world of increasing angst and despair? The essays in this book provide insight from health professionals as they discuss their ideas on compassion, offering you an opportunity to reflect and go forward with a sense of shared humanity. How do we know if someone else is conscious? This book offers a compelling bioethical analysis of one of neuroscience’s most intriguing topics: states of consciousness, bringing together contributions from international experts in neurosci...",
  "summary": "Buku *Emotional Health, from Science to Whole Being* memperkenalkan konsep kesehatan emosional sebagai keseimbangan bio-psi-sosial-budaya, yang mencakup aspek biologis, psikologis, sosial, dan budaya dalam kehidupan manusia. Dalam era modern yang penuh tantangan sosial, politik, ekonomi, dan ekologis, keseimbangan ini menjadi kunci untuk mencegah stres dan gangguan kesehatan mental. Penulis, Dr. Carol Dillon, seorang psikiater dan peneliti neurosains dari Argentina, menggabungkan pendekatan ilmiah dengan pemahaman tentang jiwa atau \"soul\", menekankan pentingnya kesadaran, keberadaan, dan pengalaman manusia dalam konteks ilmu pengetahuan teknologi. Buku ini memperkenalkan konsep *planetary health* dan keseimbangan holistik, serta memperlihatkan bagaimana kesehatan mental terkait dengan kehidupan manusia secara keseluruhan. Penulis juga membandingkan pendekatan kategoris (seperti ICD-10) dengan pendekatan berbasis dimensi psikologis dan klinis terhadap gangguan kepribadian. Buku ini menawarkan solusi integratif antara perawatan medis, terapi alternatif, dan pendekatan klinis yang memperhatikan aspek manusia secara utuh. Dengan memasukkan konsep kesadaran, sinkronisitas, penderitaan, dan kematian, buku ini menegaskan bahwa ilmu pengetahuan modern harus memperhatikan manusia sebagai makhluk bermoral dan bermakna, bukan hanya sebagai objek ilmiah. Dengan demikian, kesehatan emosional menjadi jembatan antara ilmu pengetahuan dan kehidupan bermakna yang seimbang.",
