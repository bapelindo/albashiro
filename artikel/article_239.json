  "summary": "Sebuah penelitian internasional yang melibatkan 1.144 pasien terapi listrik (ECT) dan keluarga menunjukkan bahwa penyebab masalah pasien sering diabaikan. Efek samping terbesar dari ECT adalah kehilangan memori, dengan 71% pasien mengalami kesulitan menyimpan informasi baru dan 80% kehilangan memori autobiografi sebelum terapi. Penelitian juga menemukan bahwa perempuan dua kali lebih sering menerima ECT dibandingkan laki-laki, namun mereka lebih mungkin mengalami kehilangan memori dan kurang mendapatkan manfaat. Selain itu, penelitian menemukan bahwa ECT bisa jadi tidak efektif atau bahkan merugikan. Dalam kajian terbaru, para ahli menekankan bahwa selain kehilangan memori, risiko kejadian jantung yang serius juga perlu diperhatikan. Penelitian ini memperlihatkan bahwa ECT perlu diperiksa kembali secara kritis, terutama dalam hal keamanan, keadilan, dan keberlanjutan terapi. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, hal ini mengingatkan pentingnya tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan diri—dan memperhatikan akar masalah psikologis, bukan hanya mengandalkan intervensi medis. Psikologi Islam menekankan pemahaman terhadap akar masalah, seperti kecemasan, kehilangan, atau kegagalan spiritual, serta pentingnya keseimbangan antara pengobatan fisik dan perbaikan diri. Dengan memperhatikan aspek manusia secara holistik, terapi seperti ECT harus dipertimbangkan secara kritis, dengan memperhatikan dampak jangka panjang terhadap kesehatan mental dan spiritual pasien.",
