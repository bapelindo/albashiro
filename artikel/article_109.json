An eating disorder is a mental health condition in which the person affected experiences significant disruptions in their eating behaviors as well as in their thoughts and emotions related to food. People who struggle with eating disorders often become preoccupied with food and their body weight. These conditions can be life-threatening if left untreated. Additionally, eating disorders often occur together with other mental health issues like depression, anxiety, panic disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Without treatment, eating disorders can cause a number of health-related problems including cardiovascular issues, gastrointestinal issues, and malnutrition. However, with proper treatment, people affected by eating disorders can resume health eating habits and can improve their mental health. Determining if you have an eating disorder begins with examining your thoughts and behaviors surrounding food, body image and body weight. Although there is an extensive list of warning signs, not everyone will display every symptom. If you suspect you have an eating disorder, it’s important to talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. The chance for recovery increases the sooner an eating disorder is addressed. Eating disorders are complex disorders that stem from a variety of factors including genetics, cultural ideals, environmental, psychological, and biological influences. These risk factors may also include mental health conditions like anxiety and depression along with body image issues. To help a loved one with an eating disorder, be supportive of their recovery efforts without trying to fix, control, or counsel them.﻿﻿ Instead, be patient and encouraging. Empower them to tackle their disordered eating and talk to a counselor or therapist. There is some evidence that eating disorders are heritable. In fact, in one study of twins, researchers discovered that 40% to 60% of the risk for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder arises from genetic influences. However, the development of an eating disorder is a complex process impacted by a variety of factors and not just about genetic influences. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by not eating enough and impacts all areas of a person’s life. A person affected by anorexia nervosa, may have a low body weight and a distorted body image. They also may have an intense fear of gaining weight and often use extreme measures to control their weight and shape. Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging or another method designed to prevent weight gain such as the use of laxatives, excessive exercises, and fasting. Due to guilt and shame associated with bulimia nervosa, people affected by this disorder will go to great lengths to hide their behaviors. Binge eating is an eating disorder characterized by consuming large amounts of food even when the person isn’t hungry. Typically, the person feels out of control as well as a sense of shame and guilt over their binge eating. Unlike people with bulimia nervosa, they do not try to purge the food after it is consumed. Rumination disorder is an eating disorder that involves bringing previously chewed or previously swallowed food back up in order to spit it out or re-swallow it. These behaviors are often done in secret because of a fear of what people will think. ARFID is an eating disorder in which the person affected has a strong preference for a narrow range of foods and may refuse to eat any food that is outside of these parameters. Unlike other eating disorders, people with ARFID do not worry about weight gain or body composition. During a psychological evaluation, a psychologist or therapist will use a variety of tests and assessmen...",
  "summary": "Disorder makan adalah kondisi kesehatan mental di mana seseorang mengalami gangguan signifikan dalam pola makan, pikiran, dan perasaan terkait makanan dan berat badan. Orang yang mengalami gangguan makan sering terfokus pada makanan dan ukuran tubuh, dan kondisi ini dapat berisiko nyawa jika tidak diobati. Kondisi ini sering muncul bersamaan dengan gangguan mental lain seperti depresi, kecemasan, gangguan kecemasan, dan gangguan obsesif. Jika tidak ditangani, gangguan makan dapat menyebabkan masalah fisik seperti masalah jantung, gangguan pencernaan, dan malnutrisi. Namun, dengan perawatan yang tepat, seseorang dapat kembali ke pola makan sehat dan memperbaiki kesehatan mentalnya. Penilaian terhadap gangguan makan dimulai dengan memeriksa pikiran dan perilaku terkait makanan, citra tubuh, dan berat badan. Meskipun ada banyak tanda peringatan, tidak semua orang menunjukkan semua gejala. Jika diduga mengalami gangguan makan, penting untuk berbicara dengan dokter atau profesional kesehatan mental. Semakin cepat gangguan ini diatasi, semakin besar peluang pemulihan. Gangguan makan merupakan kondisi kompleks yang dipengaruhi oleh berbagai faktor, termasuk genetika, ideal budaya, lingkungan, psikologis, dan biologis. Faktor risiko juga meliputi gangguan mental seperti kecemasan dan depresi, serta masalah citra tubuh. Untuk membantu orang terdekat yang mengalami gangguan makan, penting untuk mendukung proses pemulihan tanpa mencoba memperbaiki, mengontrol, atau memberi nasihat. Sebaliknya, bersikap sabar, menghargai, dan mendorong mereka untuk mencari bantuan konselor atau terapis. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemulihan melibatkan tazkiyatun nuf",
