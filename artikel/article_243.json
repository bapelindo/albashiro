  "summary": "Dalam artikel \"Staying on Course Through Emotional Storms,\" penulis membahas tantangan emosional yang muncul saat menulis buku, terutama menghadapi rasa cemas, rasa bersalah, dan ketakutan akan dampak dari karya tersebut. Ia merasa cemas tentang keakuratan kutipan, keberadaan bias budaya, dan apakah karyanya akan memperdalam atau memperparah perbedaan sosial. Pertanyaan-pertanyaan ini memicu \"storm emosional\" yang menyebabkan rasa bersalah dan ketakutan akan kegagalan atau kekhianatan. Penulis menggambarkan keadaan ini sebagai \"wave of shame,\" yang sering muncul saat menghadapi kekhawatiran tentang keberadaan diri dan kewajiban moral terhadap masyarakat. Dalam keadaan ini, kehadiran teman yang mendengarkan dengan empati dan menyerap semua perasaan menjadi sangat penting. Dengan dukungan seperti itu, ia merasa aman untuk mengungkapkan perasaan tidak nyaman dan bagian-bagian diri yang biasanya dihindari. Artikel ini menekankan pentingnya mengenali dan menerima perasaan emosional yang kompleks, terutama ketika menangani isu-isu besar seperti ketidakadilan sosial. Penulis juga mempertanyakan apakah menulis buku tentang ketegangan sosial adalah bentuk keberanian atau kegagalan. Namun, dengan mengakui kekhawatiran ini, ia bisa tetap bergerak maju. Konsep ini mencerminkan prinsip *tazkiyatun nufus* dalam psikologi Islam, yaitu proses perbaikan diri melalui pengenalan dan pengendalian perasaan, serta keberanian menghadapi kebenaran diri. Dengan menghadapi kecemasan dan rasa bersalah secara jujur, seseorang dapat tetap berdiri kuat dalam perjalanan spiritual dan emosional.",
