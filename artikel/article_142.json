Fine, but what are the future options? Will you be able to earn?” Since I started my journey with Islamic Psychology as a student, these are a few of the most frequently encountered questions.“Today I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed My favor upon you, and I have chosen for you Islam as your way of life (deen)” (Surah Ma’ida 5:3). In this verse, Allah (swt) has mentioned Islam as our deen, as our way of life. But have we limited Islam to just a religion with some rituals and practices; have we limited Islam to praying, fasting, hajj and zakah? Being a ‘Muslim’ means submitting and obeying Allah (swt) in every aspect of our lives, so why should we separate Islam when we are trying to understand the very creation of Allah In Surah Fussilat, verse 53, Allah (swt) mentioned that He will show us signs in this universe and within ourselves until the truth becomes clear to us. Bringing Islam into Psychology doesn’t make us ‘too Islamic’; instead, that is the whole point of Islam.Psychology is derived from the Greek word “Psyche”, which means soul or mind. Psychology, which has its roots in the study of the soul, has now been left “soul-less”. There has been a systematic evolution of psychology from the ‘study of soul’ to the ‘study of brain and behavior.’ The fall of the church in the 19th \u0026 20th centuries resulted in the separation of religion and science. Christianity holds the belief that there is a conflict in ideology and methodology between science and religion. This distinction leads to redefining psychology from ‘science of the soul’ to ‘science of behavior and mind’. As a student of psychology, I have always experienced cognitive dissonance while studying the theories of Freud, who defined belief in religion as “collective neurosis” and his overemphasis on psychosexual needs. Theories of behaviorism, focused only on observable behavior and neglected any need to understand the mind or soul in comprehending human beings. Can a complex and sophisticated human psyche be reduced to observable behavior or psychosexual needs? The “Ashraful Makhlukaat” created by Allah (swt) can be comprehended just by studying their brain and behavior? As a Muslim, these thoughts were antithetical to me. Thanks to this spiritual dilemma, which landed me in the field of Islamic psychology. In the pursuit of understanding, there exists absolutely no discord between Islam and science. As a science, Islamic psychology is a more sophisticated and holistic study of understanding the human psyche while incorporating the concept of soul, mind and body. One of the most influential and holistic models of Islamic Psychology by Prof. R. Skinner explains the interaction between Qalb, Nafs, Ruh and Aql. In his model, the Ruh (soul) is the spiritual entity in human beings which has the desire to please Allah (swt), and the desire for justice, peace and tranquillity. On the other hand, the Nafs (self) is the entity which has the desire for materialistic things, duniya, and to please oneself. Both Nafs and Ruh have desires, but whose desire overpowers the other depends on the decision of the Qalb (Heart). The Qalb comes from the root (q-l-b-), which means ‘turning over’ or ‘transforming’. The Qalb is constantly influenced by both Nafs and Ruh. The final decision maker between the ongoing battle of bodily desires of Nafs and Spiritual desires of Ruh, is the Qalb. In Islamic psychology, our psyche is explained on the basis of this battle between our Nafs and Ruh, but in Western psychology, this battle is non-existent.A few of the most influential Western psychologists, like Sigmund Freud and William James, believe in the concept of Hedonism, i.e., maximizing self-pleasure in one’s life.

  "summary": "Sebagai mahasiswa psikologi Islam, penulis membahas tantangan dalam mengintegrasikan Islam dengan studi psikologi. Menurut ayat Al-Qur’an, Islam adalah cara hidup yang mencakup semua aspek kehidupan, bukan hanya ritual seperti shalat, puasa, atau zakat. Dalam Surah Ma’ida dan Surah Fussilat, Allah (swt) menegaskan bahwa kebenaran akan terungkap melalui tanda-tanda di alam dan diri manusia. Dengan demikian, psikologi seharusnya tidak terpisah dari Islam, karena asal usul kata \"psikologi\" berasal dari \"psyche\" yang berarti jiwa atau hati. Namun, seiring perkembangan, psikologi telah berubah dari \"ilmu tentang jiwa\" menjadi \"ilmu tentang otak dan perilaku\", terpisah dari aspek spiritual. Perpecahan ini terjadi karena penurunan kekuatan agama di abad ke-19 dan ke-20, di mana agama dan ilmu ditafsirkan sebagai saling bertentangan. Dalam konteks ini, penulis menekankan bahwa mengintegrasikan Islam dalam psikologi bukan berarti menjadi terlalu \"islamis\", melainkan memperkuat kembali nilai-nilai spiritual dan keseluruhan kehidupan manusia. Dengan memahami psikologi sebagai ilmu tentang jiwa, kita dapat mengembalikan keseimbangan antara akal dan hati, antara ilmu pengetahuan dan keimanan. Ini adalah bentuk tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan jiwa—yang sesuai dengan ajaran Islam. Dengan demikian, psikologi Islam tidak hanya tentang keberhasilan karier, tetapi tentang pemahaman mendalam tentang kehidupan, kebenaran, dan keseimbangan antara akal dan hati. (198 kata)",
