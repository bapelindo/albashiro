Anda dapat mempelajari cara mengelola emosi, memperkuat hubungan, dan menghadapi situasi sulit secara lebih sehat. Sumber ini juga membahas cara membantu keluarga dan teman untuk memperbaiki kesehatan mental mereka. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, kesehatan mental terkait dengan tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan diri melalui keimanan, kesabaran, dan kedisiplinan. Praktik seperti meditasi kesadaran, rasa syukur, dan perubahan perspektif dapat membantu mengurangi kecemasan dan membangun kekuatan batin. Situs ini memperingati kehilangan Morgan Leslie Segal, yang mungkin dapat dihindari jika ia memiliki akses ke informasi dan dukungan yang lebih baik. Dengan memperkuat kesadaran diri dan membangun kepercayaan diri, seseorang dapat menghadapi tekanan, mengembalikan rasa kendali, dan memulihkan harga diri. Setiap orang perlu mendekati kesehatan mental sebagai bagian dari perjalanan spiritual dan fisik.
