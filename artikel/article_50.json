  "content": "Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn and work well, and contribute to their community. It has intrinsic and instrumental value and is a basic human right. Mental health exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next. At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition. Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm. Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment gaps are wide all over the world. The risks and protective factors that influence mental health operate at multiple levels. Individual factors such as emotional skills, substance use and genetics can increase vulnerability to mental health problems. Social and environmental factors – including poverty, violence, inequality and environmental deprivation – also increase the risk of experiencing mental health conditions. Risks can emerge at any stage of life, but those occurring during sensitive developmental periods, especially early childhood, are particularly harmful. For example, harsh parenting and physical punishment can damage child health and bullying is a leading risk factor for mental health conditions. Protective factors similarly occur throughout our lives and help build resilience. They include individual social and emotional skills, positive social interactions, access to quality education, decent work, safe neighbourhoods and strong community ties. Mental health risks and protective factors can be found at different scales. Local challenges affect individuals, families and communities, while global threats – such as economic downturns, disease outbreaks, humanitarian emergencies, forced displacement and climate change – impact entire populations. No single factor can reliably predict mental health outcomes. Many people exposed to risk factors never develop a mental health condition, while others may be affected without any known risk. However, the interplay of these determinants collectively shapes mental health over time. Promotion and prevention efforts aim to improve mental health by addressing individual, social and structural determinants of mental health. Interventions can be designed for individuals, specific groups or whole populations. Because many determinants lie outside the health sector, effective promotion and prevention programmes require cross-sector collaboration. Education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare sectors all have vital roles. The health sector can contribute by embedding promotion and prevention into its services and by leading or supporting multisectoral coordination. Suicide prevention is a global priority and part of the Sustainable Development Goals. Key strategies include limiting access to means, promoting responsible media reporting, supporting social and emotional learning for adolescents, and ensuring early intervention. Banning highly hazardous pesticides is a particularly inexpensive and cost–effective intervention for reducing suicide rates. Promoting child and adolescent mental health is another priority. Effective approaches include policies and laws that protect mental health, support for caregivers, school-based programmes and improvements to community and online environments. Among these, school-based social and emotional learning programmes are especially effective across all income levels. Mental health at work is a growing area of interest and can...",
  "summary": "Kesehatan mental adalah keadaan kesehatan mental yang memungkinkan seseorang menghadapi tekanan kehidupan, mengenali kemampuan diri, belajar, bekerja secara efektif, dan berkontribusi pada masyarakat. Ini merupakan hak dasar manusia yang memiliki nilai intrinsik dan instrumental. Kesehatan mental berada pada kontinum kompleks yang dialami secara berbeda oleh setiap individu. Faktor individu, keluarga, komunitas, dan struktural dapat memengaruhi kesehatan mental—baik sebagai pelindung maupun peningkat risiko. Meskipun sebagian besar orang memiliki ketahanan, mereka yang mengalami keadaan tidak menyenangkan lebih rentan terhadap gangguan kesehatan mental. Gangguan kesehatan mental mencakup gangguan psikologis, disabilitas psososial, serta kondisi mental yang menyebabkan ketegangan besar, gangguan fungsi, atau risiko terhadap diri sendiri. Banyak kondisi ini dapat diobati secara efektif dengan biaya rendah, namun sistem kesehatan masih terlalu terbatas dan celah perawatan masih lebar di seluruh dunia. Faktor risiko dan pelindung beroperasi pada berbagai tingkat. Faktor individu seperti keterampilan emosional, penggunaan zat, dan genetika dapat meningkatkan kecenderungan terhadap gangguan. Faktor sosial dan lingkungan seperti kemiskinan, kekerasan, ketidakadilan, dan kekurangan lingkungan juga meningkatkan risiko. Risiko terjadi di setiap tahap kehidupan, namun pada masa perkembangan, terutama masa anak-anak, dampaknya sangat besar. Misalnya, pendidikan keras dan pukulan fisik dapat merusak kesehatan anak, sementara bullying menjadi faktor risiko utama. Di sisi lain, faktor pelindung seperti keterampilan sosial, interaksi positif, akses pendidikan berkualitas, pekerjaan layak, lingkungan aman, dan ikatan komunitas ku",
