  "content": "Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition defined by periods (or episodes) of extreme mood disturbances that affect mood, thoughts, and behavior. There are two main types of bipolar disorders. Bipolar I disorder involves episodes of severe mania and often depression. Bipolar II disorder involves a less severe form of mania called hypomania. There is also a third type known as cyclothymic disorder. Research suggests that around 4.4% of U.S. adults will have bipolar disorder at some point in their lives. Genetics are thought to play a significant role, although brain abnormalities and environmental factors also contribute as causes of bipolar disorder. Mood stabilizers are usually the first-line treatment, but electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used to address severe symptoms. The exact causes of bipolar disorder are not entirely understood. Research has shown that genetics play a significant role. Other causes include changes in the brain as well as environmental factors including childhood trauma or stress caused by major life changes. Understanding the causes may help scientists develop ways to prevent or treat the condition. Research suggests there is a strong genetic component in bipolar disorder. Twin studies have found that when one identical twin has the condition, the likelihood that their twin sibling will also have it is around 40%. While there is a genetic vulnerability, inherited factors interact with environmental influences that can play a role in triggering the disorder’s onset. Bipolar disorder is typically treated with medications and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), therapy, and psychoeducation. Common medications include mood stabilizers or anticonvulsants, as well as second or third generation antipsychotics. Antidepressants are typically avoided if possible due to risks including mania and rapid cycling. Your condition may be considered a disability that is protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or qualifies you for disability payments. If your disability substantially limits your work, you may be able to request reasonable accommodations from your employer. You may qualify for disability benefits if your condition makes it impossible for you to maintain employment. Only a doctor or qualified mental health professional can diagnose you with bipolar disorder. You may want to see your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of mania, depression, or both. Symptoms of mania can include talking excessively, racing thoughts, decreased sleep, and delusions. Symptoms of depression may include fatigue, prolonged sadness, and loss of interest in activities. This type of bipolar disorder involves the presence of at least one manic episode. Manic episodes may last seven days or longer or be severe enough that a person requires acute care. People usually experience depressive episodes as well, but they may also have mixed episodes where they experience depression and mania at the same time. This type of bipolar disorder is marked by periods of depressive and hypomanic episodes without periods of full-blown mania. It involves at least one episode of depression that lasts at least two weeks and one episode of hypomania that lasts for at least four days. During hypomanic episodes, people have symptoms of mania but are still able to function.﻿﻿ This condition, also known as cyclothymia, is marked by periods of cycling between hypomania and depressive symptoms. These symptoms are persistent and  last for at least two years, but they do not meet the criteria to qualify for a diagnosis as a hypomanic or depressive episode. People who have cyclothymic disorder may have a higher risk for later developing bipolar disorder. Mania is a phase of bipolar disorder that involves elevated periods of mood, energy, thoughts, an...",
  "summary": "Disorder bipolar adalah kondisi kesehatan mental yang ditandai dengan perubahan ekstrem dalam suasana hati, pikiran, dan perilaku. Ada tiga jenis utama: Bipolar I, yang melibatkan episode mania berat dan depresi, serta Bipolar II, yang melibatkan mania ringan (hipomania). Kondisi ini memengaruhi sekitar 4,4% penduduk Amerika Serikat. Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa faktor genetik memainkan peran besar, dengan studi bersaudara menunjukkan bahwa jika satu saudara kembar memiliki bipolar, kemungkinan saudara lain juga mengalami kondisi ini mencapai 40%. Selain faktor genetik, perubahan pada otak dan faktor lingkungan seperti stres, trauma masa kecil, atau perubahan besar dalam kehidupan juga berkontribusi. Penanganan utama meliputi obat, terutama stabilisator suasana hati atau antikonvulsan, serta terapi psikologis dan edukasi psikologis. Terapi elektrokonvulsif (ECT) atau stimulasi magnet transkranial (TMS) dapat digunakan untuk gejala berat. Obat antidepresan biasanya dihindari karena risiko memperparah kondisi mania. Pengobatan komprehensif melibatkan pendekatan holistik, termasuk pemahaman terhadap dinamika emosional dan peran lingkungan. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemahaman terhadap kondisi ini dapat diperkuat melalui prinsip tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa), dengan menekankan kestabilan emosional, kepatuhan terhadap ibadah, dan keseimbangan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Penanganan bipolar harus melibatkan dukungan keluarga, terapi, dan pengawasan medis yang terus-menerus.",
