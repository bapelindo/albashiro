Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Mood disorders are conditions that severely impact a person's emotional state, ranging from depression to mania. Symptoms of mood disorders can include changes in sleep, appetite, energy, and feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness. Treatments often involve a combination of therapy and medication to help manage symptoms effectively. Mood disorders are conditions that affect a person's emotional state. There are several different types of mood disorders, including bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, cyclothymic disorder, persistent depressive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A mood disorder is a condition that severely impacts mood and its related functions. Mood disorder is a broad term that refers to the different types of depressive and bipolar disorders, all of which affect mood. If you have symptoms of a mood disorder, your moods may range from extremely low (depressed) to extremely high or irritable (manic). With the update of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in 2013, mood disorders were separated into two groups: bipolar and related disorders and depressive disorders. Types of mood disorders include: The DSM-5 added three new mood disorders. These include: The DSM-5, text revision (DSM-5-TR) added a new category within the depressive disorders and bipolar disorders chapters—it's called unspecified mood disorder. With an unspecified mood disorder, a person displays symptoms characteristic of a mood disorder, but they don't meet the criteria for a doctor to diagnose them with a depressive or bipolar disorder (including unspecified bipolar disorder or unspecified depressive disorder). It is applied to presentations where it is difficult to choose between an unspecified depressive or unspecified bipolar disorder. Mood disorders can lead to difficulty in keeping up with the daily tasks and demands of life. Some people, especially children, may have physical symptoms of depression, like unexplained headaches or stomachaches. Because there are various types of mood disorders, they can have very different effects on quality of life. In general, symptoms may include: With mood disorders, these symptoms are ongoing and eventually start to affect daily life negatively. They're not the sporadic thoughts and feelings that everyone has on occasion. If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. No one knows the exact cause of mood disorders. A variety of factors seem to contribute to them, and they tend to run in families. There is no single factor that alone causes mood disorders. Instead, a number of factors are believed to play a role, and certain things can increase a person's risk of developing a mood disorder. Some factors that can play a role include: Stressful life events like death, divorce, or trauma can also trigger depression, especially if someone has already had it before or there's a genetic component. Mood disorders should be properly evaluated and treated by a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist. If any of your symptoms have been interfering with your life, particularly if you are having suicidal thoughts, you should seek help immediately. A doctor will be able to diagnose you by performing a physical exam and lab tests to rule out any physical reasons for your symptoms along with a psychiatric evaluation. Millions of people experience mood disorders and are successfully treated, helping them live a better quality of life. Treatments for mood disorders can include ...",
  "summary": "Gangguan suasana hati, atau mood disorders, adalah kondisi yang secara signifikan memengaruhi keadaan emosional seseorang, mencakup depresi hingga mania. Gejala umum meliputi perubahan pola tidur, nafsu makan, energi, serta perasaan hilang harapan atau tidak bernilai. Gangguan ini dikelompokkan dalam dua kategori utama menurut DSM-5-TR: gangguan bipolar dan gangguan depresif. Jenis gangguan ini meliputi gangguan depresif utama, gangguan bipolar, gangguan siklik terkait, gangguan depresif kronis, dan gangguan disfonia pramenstrual. Dalam DSM-5-TR, diperkenalkan kategori baru: gangguan suasana hati tidak spesifik, yaitu kondisi di mana seseorang menunjukkan gejala mood disorder, namun tidak memenuhi kriteria diagnosis untuk gangguan depresif atau bipolar. Kondisi ini muncul ketika sulit menentukan apakah pasien mengalami gangguan depresif atau bipolar. Perawatan biasanya melibatkan kombinasi terapi dan obat untuk mengelola gejala. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemahaman tentang keseimbangan emosi dan tazkiyatun nufus (pemurnian jiwa) sangat penting. Islam menekankan pentingnya mengatur emosi melalui ibadah, refleksi, dan keberadaan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Dengan memahami gangguan suasana hati, individu dapat lebih memahami kebutuhan spiritual dan psikologis, serta memperkuat kehidupan bermasyarakat yang seimbang dan bermakna.",
