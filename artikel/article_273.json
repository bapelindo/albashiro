  "content": "Today more people than ever live in a country other than the one where they were born. While many people migrate out of choice, others migrate out of necessity. Some may be forcibly displaced from their homes as they flee persecution, conflict, violence or disaster. Others facing adversity may also have little option but to move, for example to escape inhuman treatment, avoid economic hardship, access social rights or reunite with families. Refugees and migrants exposed to adversity have diverse mental health needs, shaped by experiences in their country of origin, their migration journey, their host country’s entry and integration policies, and living and working conditions. In some contexts, they may be at greater risk of experiencing mental health conditions than their host population. Refugees and migrants face significant barriers that hamper inclusion in society and limit the accessibility and acceptability of mental health services. Addressing these typically requires targeted, multi-disciplinary action, including culturally sensitive and integrated mental health care, social support, legal assistance and community engagement. The experience of migration is a key determinant of refugee and migrant mental health. Each stage of the migration journey presents unique stressors that can increase the risk of developing mental health conditions. In all contexts, and at all stages of the migration journey, refugee and migrant mental health is influenced by diverse individual, family, community and structural factors that can be grouped into five areas. Many refugees and migrants experience distress, such as feelings of anxiety, sadness, hopelessness, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, irritability, anger and physical pains. For most people, these reactions improve over time. Others will go on to develop mental health conditions. Studies show that mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, PTSD and suicide are more prevalent among refugees and migrants than host populations. In several countries, the incidence of psychoses is also higher among migrants, linked to cumulative social disadvantages throughout the migration journey. WHO uses its three strategic approaches to support Member States in including refugees and migrants in national health systems and ensuring their access to mental health services as part of their journey towards universal health coverage. Leadership and advocacy. WHO’s Global Action Plan (2019–2023) is designed to promote the health of refugees and migrants through concerted international action and cooperation. The updated Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan (2013–2030) focuses specifically on promoting mental well-being, and reducing the impact of mental health conditions. It emphasizes the need to address disparities in access to care and improve support for at-risk groups, including refugees and migrants. Through the Global Compact on Refugees Multistakeholder pledge, WHO is committed to integrating mental health and psychosocial support in humanitarian, development and peace-building programmes. WHO also co-chairs the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings, helping to ensure coordinated mental health responses in emergencies. Norms, standards and data. WHO’s 2023 Global Evidence Review on Health and Migration (GEHM) focused on the mental health needs of refugees and migrants, identifying major risks and protective factors and making key research and policy recommendations.

These are used by most large international humanitarian organizations active in mental health. Country support.

  "summary": "Orang-orang yang menjadi pengungsi dan migran menghadapi kebutuhan kesehatan mental yang kompleks, yang dipengaruhi oleh pengalaman di negara asal, perjalanan migrasi, kebijakan integrasi di negara tujuan, serta kondisi hidup dan pekerjaan. Banyak dari mereka mengalami stres berat, seperti kecemasan, kehilangan harapan, kesulitan tidur, lelah, kemarahan, dan rasa sakit fisik. Reaksi ini umumnya membaik seiring waktu, namun bagi sebagian orang, dapat berkembang menjadi gangguan kesehatan mental seperti depresi, kecemasan, trauma pasca kejadian (PTSD), dan bahkan kecenderungan bunuh diri—yang lebih umum dibandingkan populasi di negara tujuan. Hambatan utama dalam akses layanan kesehatan mental meliputi kurangnya inklusi sosial, ketidakmampuan mengakses layanan, dan kurangnya pemahaman budaya. Solusi yang efektif memerlukan pendekatan multidisiplin yang terintegrasi, termasuk perawatan mental yang sensitif terhadap budaya, dukungan sosial, bantuan hukum, dan partisipasi komunitas. Perjalanan migrasi sendiri merupakan faktor kunci dalam menentukan kesehatan mental mereka, karena setiap tahap—dari perpindahan hingga integrasi—menghadirkan stres yang meningkatkan risiko gangguan. Faktor individu, keluarga, komunitas, dan struktural berperan penting dalam memengaruhi kesehatan mental. Oleh karena itu, kebijakan dan intervensi harus disesuaikan secara khusus, memperhatikan konteks budaya dan kebutuhan unik setiap kelompok migran. Dengan pendekatan holistik dan inklusif, kesehatan mental mereka dapat diperbaiki secara berkelanjutan.",
