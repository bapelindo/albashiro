Hannah has worked at Verywell Mind since 2022, and during that time, has overseen extensive testing of 55 different online therapy services and 27 online therapy directories, both for individuals and couples. This gives Hannah expertise in the online therapy field, where she uses the insights gained from over three years of testing to be able to knowledgeably recommend therapy services to a wide variety of therapy seekers. Hannah also uses her clinical experience to act as a subject matter expert for Verywell Mind articles about mental health conditions and services. Using a mental health app can be like having your own mini therapist in your pocket—and for some, being able to turn to an app when you need support is not only useful, but can mean the difference between suffering in silence and getting the help you need. As a licensed social worker and mental health professional, I can tell you that all apps are not created equal. Over the past few years, I’ve done extensive research and testing of the most popular mental health and therapy apps out there, and I’ve been impressed at how helpful some of them are—which has been borne out by research. Here are a few of my favorites. Mental health apps have the same goal (to improve your well-being), but they work in different ways, and offer different techniques. Here are some of the services you’ll find, and where our featured apps fit in–often, these companies offer a combination of these techniques. Online therapy: An app provided by an online therapy company gives you access to your sessions from your phone or tablet, lets you communicate with your therapist between appointments, and features resources or “homework” available between sessions—an aspect of therapy that has been proven to improve results. We recommend Talkspace and BetterHelp—read our full reviews of them below. Breathwork: Breathing exercises help you calm down by slowing and regulating your breathing, which lets your body and brain know that you are not in danger and it is safe to relax. You can use breathwork to tackle anxiety or help you prepare for sleep. I recommend aptly-named Breathwrk. Meditation: Meditating can help you slow a worried mind, focus on your feelings (both emotional and physical), and check in with yourself if you are stressed. Doing a meditation exercise can help you understand what your body is feeling, practice mindfulness by focusing on the world around you and how you are relating to it, and take a moment to check in with yourself. Headspace and Calm are two of my favorites. Journaling: Tracking your mood, thoughts, and emotions in a guided journal helps you recognize patterns in your thinking and behavior that might not otherwise be apparent. Being aware of these patterns helps you consciously react differently to stressors, which can mitigate anxiety and help you develop healthier responses to challenging situations. This is the main feature of the Worry Watch app. Costs: For mental health services: $69 to $109 per week for therapy, billed as a monthly subscription; $299 for initial psychiatry evaluation, $179 per follow-up session; Talkspace Go costs $29.99 per month Services Offered: Online therapy, messaging, classes, live workshops, reflection questions Free Trial: Yes, 7-day free trial of Talkspace Go Offers individual therapy, couples therapy, teen therapy, and psychiatry services Talkspace Go app provides additional resources like classes, meditation exercises, and educational articles Talkspace actually offe...",
  "summary": "Aplikasi kesehatan mental dapat menjadi alat yang sangat berguna seperti memiliki terapis pribadi di saku. Sebagai perawat sosial yang berpengalaman, Hannah Owens, seorang profesional kesehatan mental, telah menguji lebih dari 55 layanan terapi online dan 27 direktori terapi secara independen. Dalam peninjauan tersebut, ia menemukan bahwa aplikasi kesehatan mental memiliki tujuan yang sama—mengembangkan kesejahteraan mental—tetapi bekerja dengan cara dan teknik yang berbeda. Beberapa aplikasi menawarkan layanan terapi online, sementara yang lain fokus pada manajemen stres, tidur, dan kecemasan. Berdasarkan pengalaman klinis dan penelitian, aplikasi ini dapat menjadi solusi penting bagi mereka yang merasa tidak nyaman meminta bantuan secara langsung. Namun, perlu diketahui bahwa tidak semua aplikasi sama baiknya. Pemilihan aplikasi harus berdasarkan kebutuhan individu, seperti jenis gangguan mental atau kebutuhan psikologis. Dalam konteks Islam, kesehatan mental juga berkaitan erat dengan *tazkiyatun nufus* (peningkatan akhlak dan kehendak batin), di mana kesadaran diri, refleksi diri, dan keseimbangan emosi menjadi bagian dari perawatan mental. Aplikasi dapat mendukung proses ini dengan membantu pengguna memahami emosi dan mengelola ketegangan. Namun, tetap perlu disadari bahwa aplikasi tidak bisa menggantikan konseling profesional atau perawatan spiritual. Kesehatan mental terbaik dibangun dari kombinasi antara teknologi, kebiasaan sehat, dan pengaruh spiritual.",
