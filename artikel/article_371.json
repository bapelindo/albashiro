Genetics may indicate a risk for depression, but do not always determine whether a person will develop this all-too-common mental health disorder. There is no \"number one cause\" of depression, and even more complex is the relationship between genetics, depression, and other known contributing factors. If you were told you have a “depression gene,” you might worry you will become depressed. However, having a genetic predisposition to a condition does not always mean you will get it. It simply means you may be more susceptible to it than someone who doesn’t have the same genetic makeup. As far as researchers know, the interplay of genes and other factors (such as environment and trauma) determine whether someone develops depression. Some studies have indicated that someone with a first-degree relative diagnosed with depression (a parent, sibling, or child) could be three times more likely to be diagnosed with depression in their lifetime compared to the general population. However, it’s important to note that while studies have suggested a clear link within families, these findings don’t account for those who develop depression without a family history. Research has demonstrated that genes play a role in the potential risk for many health conditions, including depression. Studies have suggested there is a heritable component to depression.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Some research has also indicated that women may be more susceptible to the genetic influences associated with depression than men.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Heredity is a complex interplay of many factors, not just individual genes. When studying depression or other health conditions, researchers often look for changes in genes called variants. These changes are classified according to the effect (if any) they have on the gene. Eye color is an example of how variants affect genes. Changes in certain genes that affect melanin production, as well as several other genes, determine what color your eyes are. You inherit a combination of genes, each with their own unique variants, from your parents. Families can often predict what color a child's eyes will be by looking to parents and other close relatives, but variants can behave unexpectedly. For example, parents with blue eyes may have a child with brown eyes. Heritability is a complex process, even for a seemingly simple trait like eye color. For conditions like depression, research has not yet determined the full implications of genetic variations. Having a genetic variant can make it more likely—but not definitive—that you will develop a condition associated with that variant. If a gene associated with a specific condition is altered, it may be more (or less) likely to contribute to the development of that condition. A benign genetic variant is less likely to influence the condition than a pathogenic variant. In some cases, researchers identify a genetic variant but don’t know what (if any) effect it has. These variants are referred to as having \"unknown significance.\" Several large genome-wide studies have proposed potential genetic connections to major depressive disorder. In 2017, researchers identified two new genetic variants associated with depression. A 2018 study published in the journal Nature Genetics identified several genetic variants that appeared to be associated with symptoms of depression and, in some cases, physical differences in the brain.

  "summary": "Depresi dapat memiliki komponen genetik, tetapi tidak berarti bahwa seseorang akan pasti mengalami depresi hanya karena memiliki keluarga dengan riwayat depresi. Meskipun ada penelitian yang menunjukkan bahwa individu dengan keluarga dekat seperti orang tua, saudara, atau anak yang menderita depresi memiliki risiko tiga kali lebih tinggi, hal ini tidak berarti bahwa depresi diturunkan secara pasti. Faktor genetik hanya meningkatkan kecenderungan atau kepekaan terhadap depresi, bukan menjamin kejadian penyakit tersebut. Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa interaksi antara faktor genetik dan lingkungan—seperti stres, trauma, atau kehidupan sosial—menentukan apakah seseorang akan mengalami depresi. Selain itu, perbedaan gender juga terlihat, di mana perempuan cenderung lebih peka terhadap pengaruh genetik terkait depresi dibandingkan pria. Oleh karena itu, depresi bukan hanya soal gen, melainkan hasil dari kombinasi antara faktor genetik, lingkungan, dan pengalaman hidup. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, hal ini juga dapat dipahami melalui konsep *tazkiyatun nufus* (perbaikan jiwa), di mana perbaikan mental dan spiritual dapat mengatasi kecenderungan genetik. Dengan pendekatan holistik seperti ini, seseorang dapat mengelola risiko depresi melalui kebiasaan positif, dukungan sosial, dan perbaikan diri secara spiritual. Kesimpulannya, meskipun faktor genetik memainkan peran, depresi bukan tak terhindarkan, dan bisa dicegah melalui pengelolaan faktor lingkungan dan kehidupan sehari-hari.",
