Nancy has a lifetime of experience with depression, experiencing firsthand how devastating this illness can be. Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Persistent depressive disorder (PDD), formerly known as dysthymia, is a mood disorder that is characterized by a milder but more chronic form of depression. This diagnosis reflects a spectrum of severity that can range from mild to severe; however, in its most severe form, it still does not meet the criteria for major depression. Essentially, it is a prolonged state of depression with fewer symptoms than major depressive disorder (MDD). In 2013, the 5th edition of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-5) consolidated dysthymia and chronic major depressive disorder into a new diagnosis known as \"persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia),\" with dysthymia in parentheses. These diagnostic changes were made to reflect the fact that there was no scientifically or clinically meaningful distinction between \"chronic\" major depressive disorder and what was previously known as dysthymic disorder. The latest version of the DSM was published in 2022 and has some text revisions (DSM-5-TR), including the removal of \"(dysthymia)\" that once followed the PDD diagnosis. The American Psychiatric Association explained that there were enough changes made to the diagnostic criteria that keeping it may be \"misleading and potentially confusing.\" The word dysthymia comes from the Greek roots dys, meaning \"ill\" or \"bad,\" and thymia, meaning \"mind\" or \"emotions.\" The term dysthymia refers to a chronic state of depression. The symptoms of persistent depressive disorder (PDD) are very similar to major depressive disorder. However, there is a wider range of symptoms available on the criteria list for major depression. You need to have three of the seven symptoms for PDD as opposed to five out of nine symptoms for MDD. The main symptom of PDD is a sad or depressed mood nearly every day. In children, the mood may manifest as irritability. In addition to depressed/irritable mood, at least two of the following symptoms are present: The additional symptoms in the criteria list for MDD, (not included for PDD), are: The symptoms of PDD are chronic, meaning that people experience a depressed mood for most days for a period of at least two years. The timeframe has been reduced to one year for children and teens. In that two-year time frame for adults, they cannot be without symptoms for more than two months at a time. While MDD includes more symptoms, the time frame is shorter. A diagnosis of major depression requires symptoms that last for a period of at least two weeks; however, it often lasts several months. The majority (80%) of people have fully recovered within one year. People with MDD may completely recover and never experience an episode of major depression again. However, one episode of MDD is a risk factor for developing PDD and/or recurrent major depression episodes down the road. A person meeting the diagnostic criteria for persistent depressive disorder can also experience major depressive episodes. When the major depressive episode has ended, however, there is a return to the previous milder state of chronic depression rather than an absence of depressive symptoms. This co-occurrence of PDD and MDD is sometimes referred to as double depression. Another distinction is that PDD may have an earlier onset than MDD, with symptoms first appearing during the childhood, teen, or young adult years. MDD is more likely to occur after puberty, peaking in early adulthood, but can occur at any time throughout adulthood. Like other forms of depression, the exact cause of PDD is not known, but there are a number of factors that are believed to play a role, including: In many cases, th...",
  "summary": "Disorder depresi kronis (PDD), dulu dikenal sebagai dysthymia, adalah gangguan emosional yang ditandai dengan keadaan depresi yang berkepanjangan namun lebih ringan dibandingkan depresi mayor. Meskipun gejalanya mirip dengan depresi mayor, PDD memiliki durasi lebih panjang dan tidak mencapai kriteria depresi mayor secara intensitas. Pada edisi ke-5 DSM (DSM-5), gangguan ini digabungkan dengan depresi kronis besar, sehingga dikenal sebagai Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD). Perubahan ini dilakukan karena tidak ada perbedaan klinis atau ilmiah yang signifikan antara depresi kronis dan depresi mayor. Dalam versi terbaru DSM-5-TR (2022), istilah \"(dysthymia)\" dihapus karena dapat menimbulkan kebingungan dan tidak akurat. Kata \"dysthymia\" berasal dari bahasa Yunani, \"dys\" berarti buruk, dan \"thymia\" berarti perasaan atau pikiran, menggambarkan keadaan depresi kronis. PDD biasanya memengaruhi fungsi sehari-hari, namun gejala tidak seberat depresi mayor. Penanganan PDD melibatkan pendekatan psikologis, terapi, dan seringkali pengobatan obat. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemahaman terhadap kondisi ini dapat diperkuat melalui konsep tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan diri melalui ibadah, ketekunan, dan keseimbangan emosional. Pemahaman terhadap PDD penting untuk memahami bahwa depresi bukan kelemahan, melainkan kondisi medis yang memerlukan perhatian, dukungan, dan pengobatan yang tepat.",
