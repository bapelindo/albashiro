  "content": "You already know that exercise is good for your body. But did you know it can also boost your mood, improve your sleep, and help you deal with depression, anxiety, stress, and more? Exercise is not just about aerobic capacity and muscle size. Sure, exercise can improve your physical health and your physique, trim your waistline, improve your sex life, and even add years to your life. But that’s not what motivates most people to stay active. People who exercise regularly tend to do so because it gives them an enormous sense of well-being. They feel more energetic throughout the day, sleep better at night, have sharper memories, and feel more relaxed and positive about themselves and their lives. And it’s also a powerful medicine for many common mental health challenges. Regular exercise can have a profoundly positive impact on depression, anxiety, and ADHD. It also relieves stress, improves memory, helps you sleep better, and boosts your overall mood. And you don’t have to be a fitness fanatic to reap the benefits. Research indicates that modest amounts of exercise can make a real difference. No matter your age or fitness level, you can learn to use exercise as a powerful tool to deal with mental health problems, improve your energy and outlook, and get more out of life. Studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication—but without the side-effects, of course. As one example, a 2019 study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour may reduce the risk of major depression by 26 percent. In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing. Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that energize your spirits and make you feel good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression. Exercise is a natural and effective anti-anxiety treatment. It relieves tension and stress, boosts physical and mental energy, and enhances well-being through the release of endorphins. Anything that gets you moving can help, but you’ll get a bigger benefit if you pay attention instead of zoning out. Try to notice the sensation of your feet hitting the ground, for example, or the rhythm of your breathing, or the feeling of the wind on your skin. By adding this mindfulness element—really focusing on your body and how it feels as you exercise—you’ll not only improve your physical condition faster, but you may also be able to interrupt the flow of constant worries running through your head. BetterHelp is an online therapy service that matches you to licensed, accredited therapists who can help with depression, anxiety, relationships, and more. Take the assessment and get matched with a therapist in as little as 48 hours. Ever noticed how your body feels when you’re under stress? Your muscles may be tense, especially in your face, neck, and shoulders, leaving you with back or neck pain, or painful headaches. You may feel a tightness in your chest, a pounding pulse, or muscle cramps. You may also experience problems such as insomnia, heartburn, stomachache, diarrhea, or frequent urination. The worry and discomfort of all these physical symptoms can in turn lead to even more stress, creating a vicious cycle between your mind and body. Exercising is an effective way to break this cycle. As well as releasing endorphins in the brain, physical activity helps to relax the muscles and relieve tension in the body. Since the body and mind are so closely linked, ...",
  "summary": "Latihan fisik tidak hanya membantu kesehatan tubuh, tetapi juga memberikan manfaat besar bagi kesehatan mental. Aktivitas fisik dapat meningkatkan suasana hati, memperbaiki kualitas tidur, dan membantu mengatasi depresi, kecemasan, stres, dan gangguan ADHD. Meskipun manfaat fisik seperti peningkatan kekuatan otot dan penurunan leher memang penting, sebagian besar orang memilih beraktivitas karena rasanya lebih segar, lebih energik, dan merasa lebih positif terhadap diri dan hidupnya. Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa bahkan jumlah latihan ringan—seperti berjalan kaki selama satu jam atau berlari 15 menit sehari—dapat mengurangi risiko depresi utama hingga 26 persen. Latihan juga berperan sebagai terapi alami yang efektif untuk mengatasi depresi ringan hingga sedang, bahkan bisa seefektif obat antidepresan tanpa efek samping. Selain itu, olahraga mendorong perubahan positif di otak, seperti pertumbuhan neuron, pengurangan peradangan, dan pola aktivitas baru yang mendukung kesehatan mental. Latihan rutin juga membantu mencegah kambuhnya gangguan mental. Penting diketahui bahwa tidak perlu menjadi atlet profesional untuk mendapatkan manfaat ini. Setiap orang, terlepas dari usia atau tingkat fisik, dapat memulai dengan aktivitas ringan dan memanfaatkan olahraga sebagai alat untuk memperbaiki energi, memperkuat kepercayaan diri, dan meningkatkan kualitas hidup secara keseluruhan. Dengan demikian, olahraga menjadi salah satu terapi alami yang kuat dalam menjaga kesehatan mental.",
