We work to break down stigma and discrimination, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. Great news for all of us! As of January 31, 2025, Talk Mental Health ID has officially been registered as Yayasan Jiwa Pulih Bahagia. This milestone marks our commitment to creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive space for young people to talk and learn about mental health. With our new foundation status, we hope to expand our positive impact, reach more individuals, and develop more sustainable programs to support mental well-being in our community. Together, we can continue raising awareness and breaking the stigma surrounding mental health! We provide workshops, seminars, and resources on mental health literacy, helping young people understand and manage their mental well being. We work with schools, universities, and community groups to foster environments where mental health can be discussed openly and without fear of judgment. Through peer counseling, mentorship, programs and leadership opportunities, we empower youth to take control of their mental health and support their communities. Some stories remain buried for survival, but for Fransisca Wulandari, Founder of Talk Mental Health Indonesia (TMH.id), uncovering them became a powerful step toward healing and transformation. At Kanthari Talk 2024, she shares her deeply personal journey navigating struggles, overcoming challenges, and witnessing the gaps in mental health awareness in Indonesia. These experiences became the foundation of TMH.id and Tembi Arunika, initiatives dedicated to creating safe spaces for mental health conversations and support. “This isn’t just my story, but a story of family, forgiveness, and turning pain into purpose. It’s about resilience, healing, and bringing hope to those who are still struggling in silence.” For many, speaking about mental health remains a challenge due to stigma and misunderstanding. Through her journey, Fransisca has learned that healing begins when we allow ourselves to be vulnerable, to share our truths, and to support one another. Her participation in Kanthari Talk 2024 is not just about telling her story. It’s about changing the conversation around mental health, fostering understanding, and inspiring others to embrace their own healing journeys. With Kanthari, she continues her mission to create a more open, accepting, and supportive community, ensuring that no one has to face their struggles alone. Through TMH.id, she hopes to empower individuals, advocate for mental health awareness, and break the silence because every story deserves to be heard. We organize both online and offline sessions aimed at fostering emotional awareness, coping strategies, resilience-building, and using terms and language that are more relatable to our target audience. Through small group discussions and reflective workshops, we create spaces for mutual support, trust-building, and safe environments where individuals can speak openly and be their authentic selves. We use art as a medium for healing and self-discovery through visual journaling, dance (body movement therapy), zine-making, and storytelling. We integrate nature-based experiences to help people slow down, engage their senses, and ground themselves. Mental health is deeply tied to socio-cultural, political, and environmental factors—therefore, we take an intersectional and trauma-informed approach, believing that everyone deserves to be seen, heard, and supported. A collection of experiences from participants who found clarity, comfort, and connection through our sessions. Reflections from participants who experienced growth, grounding, and meaningful support throughout their journey with us. “This program helped me understand grief in a gentle and human way.

  "summary": "Talk Mental Health Indonesia (TMH.id) adalah organisasi yang berkomitmen membangun kesadaran dan pemahaman tentang kesehatan mental di kalangan pemuda. Dengan status resmi sebagai Yayasan Jiwa Pulih Bahagia pada tanggal 31 Januari 2025, TMH.id memperkuat komitmen untuk menciptakan ruang aman, inklusif, dan mendukung bagi remaja dalam berdiskusi tentang kesehatan mental. Organisasi ini berfokus pada pemberian edukasi, pelatihan, dan sumber daya terkait literasi kesehatan mental, serta membangun lingkungan di sekolah, universitas, dan komunitas di mana permasalahan mental dapat dibicarakan tanpa rasa takut atau diskriminasi. Melalui workshop, seminar, konseling teman sebaya, mentorship, dan peluang kepemimpinan, TMH.id membangkitkan kekuatan diri dan memfasilitasi pemuda untuk mengelola kesehatan mental mereka sendiri. Perjalanan pribadi pendiri, Fransisca Wulandari, menjadi inspirasi utama dalam pendirian TMH.id dan inisiatif Tembi Arunika. Dalam perjalanan ini, ia mengungkapkan perjuangan pribadi, kehilangan, dan proses pemulihan, yang menunjukkan bahwa kesehatan mental bukan hanya soal kesehatan fisik, tapi juga tentang keluarga, pengampunan, dan transformasi melalui ketahanan. Cerita ini menjadi dasar bagi pembangunan ruang aman bagi pemuda yang masih berada dalam kesulitan. Dengan status yayasan, TMH.id berkomitmen untuk memperluas dampak positif, menciptakan program yang lebih berkelanjutan, dan membawa harapan bagi generasi muda yang masih berjuang dalam keheningan.",
