  "content": "We all want to be happy. But is becoming happier even possible? These five tips can show you how to get more joy and satisfaction out of life. Do you, like many people, have a mental list of things you think you need in order to be truly happy? There are many externals our society teaches us to chase: success, wealth, fame, power, good looks, romantic love. But are they really the keys to happiness? The research says no, at least when it comes to long-term happiness. A prestigious award, a big raise, an exciting new relationship, a fancy new car, losing weight, these things can make us feel great at first, but the thrill doesn’t last very long. Human beings are quick to adapt to new circumstances—a quality that has helped us survive and thrive. But it also means that the positive things that initially make us happier soon become our new normal and we return to our old happiness baseline. However, researchers in the field of positive psychology have found that you can genuinely increase your happiness and overall satisfaction with life—and it doesn’t require a winning lottery ticket or some other drastic change of circumstances. What it takes is an inner change of perspective and attitude. And that’s truly good news, because it’s something anyone can do. There are a lot of myths out there about what will make you happy. So, before we embark on a tour of the strategies that do work for boosting happiness, let’s dispense with the things that don’t. It’s stressful when you’re worried about money. In order to be happy, you do need enough of it to cover your basic needs: things like food, shelter, and clothing. But once you have enough money to be comfortable, getting more money isn’t going to make much of a difference in how happy you are. For example, studies of lottery winners show that after a relatively short period of time, they are no happier than they were before their win. You need a relationship in order to be happy. Being in a healthy, supportive love relationship does contribute to happiness, but it’s not true that you can’t be happy and fulfilled if you’re single. Indeed, singles who have meaningful friendships and pursuits are happier than people in mismatched romantic relationships. It’s also important to note that even a good marriage or romantic partnership doesn’t lead to a permanent, intense happiness boost. Expecting your partner to deliver your happily-ever-after may actually harm the relationship in the long-run. You—not your partner or your family members—are responsible for your own happiness. Contrary to popular belief, people tend to get happier with age. Study after study confirms that seniors experience more positive emotions and fewer (and less intense) negative emotions than young people and middle-aged adults. Generally, older adults are also more satisfied with their lives, less sensitive to stress, and more emotionally stable. Even with the losses that come with age, it is the happiest time of life for many people. Some people are just happier than others and there’s nothing you can do to change that. Genetics do play a role in happiness. Current research suggests that people are born with a certain happiness “set point.” But that only accounts for about half of our happiness level. Another 10% is due to life circumstances. That leaves 40% that is determined by your actions and choices. That’s a lot of control! Our brains are wired to notice and remember the things that are wrong. It’s a survival mechanism that helped keep our cave-dwelling ancestors safe in a world where there were many physical threats. But in today’s comparatively safe world, this biological predisposition to focus on the negative contributes to stress and unhappiness. While we can’t change our nature, we can train our brains to be more positive. This doesn’t mean putting on a smiley face and whistling a happy tune no matter what’s going on. You don’t have to ign...",
  "summary": "Kita semua ingin bahagia, tetapi apakah memang mungkin menjadi lebih bahagia? Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kebahagiaan jangka panjang tidak bergantung pada hal-hal eksternal seperti keberhasilan, kekayaan, reputasi, atau cinta romantis. Meski hal-hal seperti hadiah besar, kenaikan gaji, atau hubungan baru bisa membuat kita merasa bahagia sementara, kebahagiaan ini cepat berkurang karena kecenderungan manusia untuk beradaptasi terhadap perubahan. Dalam psikologi positif, diketahui bahwa kebahagiaan sejati berasal dari perubahan dalam perspektif dan sikap batin. Hal ini bisa dicapai tanpa perubahan besar dalam kehidupan, melainkan melalui perubahan dalam cara kita memandang dunia. Fakta menunjukkan bahwa setelah mencapai kebutuhan dasar seperti makanan, tempat tinggal, dan pakaian, tambahan kekayaan tidak meningkatkan kebahagiaan. Bahkan, para pemenang lotere tidak menjadi lebih bahagia dalam jangka panjang. Selain itu, hubungan yang sehat memang penting, namun kebahagiaan tidak hanya berasal dari kehadiran pasangan. Kunci kebahagiaan adalah perubahan dalam diri—melalui kesadaran, kepercayaan diri, dan keseimbangan batin. Dalam konteks Islam, konsep *tazkiyatun nufus* (perbaikan jiwa) sangat relevan, karena menekankan pentingnya memperbaiki akhlak, kepercayaan diri, dan ketenangan batin. Dengan memperkuat nilai-nilai seperti keadilan, kejujuran, dan keikhlasan, seseorang dapat menciptakan kebahagiaan yang tahan lama dan berkelanjutan. Kebahagiaan bukanlah hasil dari kekayaan atau keberhasilan, melainkan dari keadaan batin yang seimbang dan penuh kepercayaan.",
