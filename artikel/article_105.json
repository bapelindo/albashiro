  "content": "Understanding the patterns that shape personality disorders Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Everyone has a unique mix of traits that make up their personality. Our personalities make us who we are, influencing how we express ourselves, see the world, and interact with others. According to the American Psychiatric Association, a person with a healthy personality is able to cope with life's stresses, maintain intimate relationships, and develop successful friendships. Sometimes, however, people experience enduring patterns of behaving, thinking, and feeling that differ significantly from the cultural expectations of a population. In such cases, they may be diagnosed with what is known as a personality disorder. These mental health conditions create significant distress and impairment in a person's life. The \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-5-TR) outlines 10 specific personality disorders. Each is characterized by unique patterns affecting emotional regulation, self-image, and interpersonal relationships. Below, take a closer look at how personality disorders are defined in the DSM-5-TR, the signs and symptoms of these conditions, what causes them, and the different treatments that are available. Personality disorders include the 10 diagnosable psychiatric conditions that are recognized and described in the fifth and most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR). Each is a distinct mental illness defined by personality traits that can be troubling enough to create problems with relating to other people in healthy ways, and can lead to significant distress or impairment in important areas of functioning The DSM-5-TR organizes personality disorders into three groups, or clusters, based on shared key features. These personality disorders are characterized by odd or eccentric behavior. People with cluster A personality disorders tend to experience major disruptions in relationships because their behavior may be perceived as peculiar, suspicious, or detached. The cluster B personality disorders are characterized by dramatic or erratic behavior. People who have a personality disorder from this cluster tend to either experience very intense emotions or engage in extremely impulsive, theatrical, promiscuous, or law-breaking behaviors. Research indicates that the cluster B personality disorders are the most common type in clinical settings. They often lead to severe impairments in function, require substantial treatment, and have a suicide rate 50 times that of the general population. Cluster C personality disorders are characterized by anxiety. People with personality disorders in this cluster tend to experience pervasive anxiety and/or fearfulness. According to the DSM-5-TR, personality disorders tend to appear in adolescence or early adulthood, continue over many years, and can cause a great deal of distress. They can potentially cause enormous conflict with other people, impacting relationships, social situations, and life goals. People with personality disorders often don't recognize that they have problems and are often confusing and frustrating to the people around them. This can include mental health professionals, which is why personality disorders can sometimes be challenging to diagnose. Certain symptoms of personality disorders can fall into two categories: self-identity and interpersonal functioning. According to the DMS-5-TR, a person must meet the following criteria to be diagnosed with a personality disorder: Before a mental health professional or doctor can diagnose a personality disorder, they must make a differential diagnosis to rule out other disorders or medical conditions that may be causing the symptoms. A differential diagnosis is very important, but can be difficult since personality disorders also commonly co-occur wi...",
  "summary": "Personality disorders adalah kondisi psikologis yang ditandai dengan pola berpikir, emosi, dan perilaku yang berkepanjangan dan berbeda dari norma budaya, menyebabkan kesulitan dalam hubungan sosial, pengaturan emosi, dan fungsi sehari-hari. Menurut DSM-5-TR, ada sepuluh gangguan kepribadian yang dibagi ke dalam tiga kelompok berdasarkan ciri khas: gangguan kepribadian klasik (Cluster A), yang mencakup perilaku aneh atau ekstrim; gangguan kepribadian yang menekankan kecemasan dan ketegangan (Cluster B), seperti gangguan kepribadian histeris, paranoid, atau manik; dan gangguan kepribadian yang berkaitan dengan kecenderungan sosial (Cluster C), seperti gangguan kepribadian skizoid atau paranoid. Kondisi ini menyebabkan gangguan dalam hubungan, kesulitan mengatur diri, dan ketidakmampuan menanggulangi stres. Penyebabnya melibatkan faktor genetik, lingkungan, dan pengalaman masa kecil. Perawatan meliputi terapi psikologis, seperti terapi perilaku dan kognitif, serta terapi obat jika diperlukan. Dalam konteks Islam, pemahaman tentang kesehatan mental juga berkaitan dengan tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan akhlak dan keberadaan rohani—yang mendorong kesadaran diri, keseimbangan emosi, dan kepercayaan diri. Dengan memperkuat nilai-nilai seperti kejujuran, kesabaran, dan kepedulian, seseorang dapat mengatasi pola negatif dan membangun kehidupan yang lebih seimbang dan harmonis secara spiritual dan psikologis.",
