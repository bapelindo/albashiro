From difficulties focusing on schoolwork to power struggles about sitting still at the dinner table, from friction in social situations due to the tendency to interrupt to the erosion of marriages over forgotten household chores, an ADHD diagnosis can impair daily functioning in meaningful ways. A new study, however, suggests that it also can come with strengths that, if embraced, serve to improve one's quality of life, rather than detract from it. The research, published by Cambridge University Press, involved a collaboration of experts from the University of Bath, King's College London, and Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. They looked at 200 adults with ADHD and compared them to 200 adults without. The 400 participants all came from the United Kingdom and represented a mix of males and females with various education levels. Their mean age was 33. They were asked to consider 25 life strengths and assess themselves for how well they identified with them. It turned out that those with ADHD were significantly more likely than those in the non-ADHD group to identify with 10 particular strengths. Those strengths included seeing themselves as \"creative,\" \"imaginative,\" \"up for anything,\" \"seeing opportunities,\" \"having broad interests,\" \"intuitive,\" and showing \"hyperfocus\" and \"humor.\" To a slightly lesser extent, they were also more likely to see themselves as \"inquisitive\" and \"associative/seeing connections.\" The researchers also found a strong connection between strengths knowledge and strengths use, as measured by the 14-item Strengths Use Scale, suggesting a high correlation between the actual awareness of one's strengths and the utilization of them in everyday life. This helps validate the idea that these strengths are not just abstract or hypothetical, but actually lead to greater efficacy in the areas that were endorsed. Even more striking, greater strength use was correlated with a higher quality of life. And though the overall quality of life was self-reported to be lower in the ADHD group than the non-ADHD group, strengths acknowledgment and strengths use help mitigate that difference. In other words, the more that someone recognizes and uses their strengths, the higher their overall well-being. And this study, the first of its kind to explicate the ways in which different specific strengths are acknowledged among those with ADHD, can help lead to more individualized interventions. Perhaps it's time for a reconceptualization of how to best support those with ADHD. Though the impairments that it creates should not be minimized, and they absolutely require their own interventions, there is also cause to believe that an additional focus of treatment is needed. If we can help those with ADHD realize that it may carry with it unique assets that can even help a person do better in certain areas than if they didn't have ADHD, this could help lead to even better quality of life, and help prove that-- as with many psychological disorders-- there is room for hope and reason to believe that being \"typical\" and completely free of differences is not always optimal. Certain components of ADHD may not always impair life, but rather can potentially enrich it. Luca D. Hargitai, Emma L. M. Laan, Lessa M. Schippers, Lucy A.

  "summary": "Sebuah penelitian baru dari Cambridge University Press menunjukkan bahwa gangguan gangguan perhatian hiperaktif (ADHD) tidak hanya membawa tantangan, tetapi juga memiliki kekuatan yang dapat meningkatkan kualitas hidup. Penelitian ini melibatkan 400 orang dewasa dari Inggris, terdiri dari 200 orang dengan ADHD dan 200 tanpa ADHD, dengan usia rata-rata 33 tahun. Para peserta diminta menilai 25 kekuatan hidup, dan hasilnya menunjukkan bahwa orang dengan ADHD lebih cenderung mengidentifikasi diri sebagai \"kreatif,\" \"imajinatif,\" \"bersemangat,\" \"mencari peluang,\" \"memiliki minat luas,\" \"intuitif,\" serta memiliki \"fokus hiper\" dan \"humor.\" Kekuatan ini menunjukkan bahwa individu dengan ADHD cenderung lebih terhubung dengan sifat-sifat positif yang dapat dimanfaatkan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Penelitian juga menemukan korelasi kuat antara kesadaran akan kekuatan diri dan penggunaannya dalam kehidupan nyata, yang menandakan bahwa kekuatan tersebut bukan hanya konsep abstrak, tetapi dapat diaplikasikan secara nyata. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, hal ini sesuai dengan prinsip *tazkiyatun nufus*—perbaikan jiwa—dengan memanfaatkan kelebihan dan kekuatan diri untuk memperkuat kehidupan bermakna. Dengan mengenali dan memanfaatkan kekuatan-kekuatan ini, individu dengan ADHD dapat mengatasi tantangan sehari-hari, membangun kepercayaan diri, dan memperkuat hubungan sosial. Penelitian ini menekankan pentingnya memandang ADHD bukan hanya sebagai gangguan, tetapi sebagai sumber kekuatan yang dapat dikembangkan melalui kesadaran diri dan pengelolaan diri yang baik.",
