The demand for online therapy, or teletherapy, has grown significantly in recent years. Between therapists offering virtual sessions and dozens of new subscription services covering a wide range of mental health needs, online therapy has quickly become a major part of the present and future of mental healthcare. Thanks to its convenience, accessibility, and in many cases affordability, online therapy figures to grow even more popular as individuals become more aware of its benefits. Historically, telehealth has often not been covered. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, many insurers began covering teletherapy for in-network providers. Telehealth subscription services like Talkspace and BetterHelp may be covered depending on your plan. Online therapy can be effective for dealing with a number of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and stress. Couples may also benefit from online relationship counseling. Research has shown that online therapy can be just as effective as in-person therapy for a number of conditions. Additionally, the convenience of teletherapy makes it a preferred option for many people. Traditionally therapy can cost $100 to $150 an hour or more. Services like Talkspace and BetterHelp typically charge between $60 to $90 per week. In both cases, insurance or financial assistance may help reduce the financial burden depending on your circumstances. Also known as teletherapy, online therapy is psychotherapy that takes place over the Internet. It may involve texting, email, or voice and video chat. Teletherapy can be provided by a private therapist who typically sees patients in person, or by companies like BetterHelp and Talkspace which only treat individuals through an online service. Online marriage or couples counseling is relationship counseling that takes place over the Internet. Couples may work with a therapist together or individually to help resolve relationship issues outside the traditional therapy setting. Sex therapy can help individuals and couples improve their sexual satisfaction if they are experiencing issues in the bedroom that are not tied to a medical problem. Not all therapists are trained in dealing with these issues, so it may require extra searching to find a sex therapist to work with online. Anger management is a type of counseling that can help individuals whose anger is interfering with daily life and causing them to act out in unhealthy ways. Many online therapy providers offer anger management services. Christian counseling is an approach to therapy through a Biblical, faith-based lens. There are a number of online providers with counseling services that cater to members of the Christian community dealing with mental health issues, marital struggles, and more. Text therapy is a type of online therapy that allows users to exchange text messages with a mental health professional throughout the day via an app or chat platform. This can be a convenient option for those who don't have time in their schedule for longer live sessions. Group therapy is a method of counseling or support that takes place within a group setting filled with individuals going through similar issues. A number of services provide online group support for things like addiction, divorce, and other mental health issues. A number of online therapy services offer counseling and therapy with the LGBTQ+ community in mind. LGBTQ+ individuals face a higher risk of mental health issues, but online therapy can help overcome some of the disparities that have reduced their access to treatment in the past. Grief counseling can help you process a loss—whether it is the loss of a loved one, a relationship, or even a job. Online therapy, grief counseling, and support groups can all pla...",
  "summary": "Terapi online, atau teletherapy, merupakan layanan kesehatan mental yang dapat diakses melalui perangkat komputer atau ponsel, memungkinkan seseorang mendapatkan bantuan profesional tanpa harus pergi ke klinik. Kebutuhan terapi online meningkat secara signifikan, terutama setelah pandemi COVID-19, karena keunggulannya dalam hal kenyamanan, aksesibilitas, dan biaya. Banyak perusahaan asuransi kini mencakup biaya terapi online untuk penyedia layanan dalam jaringan. Layanan seperti Talkspace dan BetterHelp menawarkan harga yang lebih terjangkau, berkisar antara $60 hingga $90 per minggu, dibandingkan dengan biaya konvensional yang bisa mencapai $100 hingga $150 per jam. Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terapi online dapat memberikan efek yang setara dengan terapi tatap muka untuk berbagai gangguan mental seperti depresi, kecemasan, kecemasan panik, dan stres. Terapi online juga dapat digunakan untuk konseling pasangan. Terapi ini bisa dilakukan melalui pesan teks, email, atau video call, dan dapat dilakukan oleh terapis pribadi maupun platform digital. Meskipun terapi online semakin populer, penting untuk mempertimbangkan kebutuhan individu dan konteks budaya, termasuk dalam konteks psikologi Islam, di mana tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) dan keseimbangan emosi tetap menjadi dasar dalam menjaga kesehatan mental. Dengan akses yang lebih mudah, terapi online menjadi solusi yang efektif dan terjangkau bagi banyak orang, terutama di lingkungan yang membutuhkan dukungan psikologis secara terus-menerus.",
