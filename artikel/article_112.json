Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by obsessions and compulsions that interfere with daily life. OCD was formerly classified as an anxiety disorder because people affected by this mental illness often experience severe anxiety as a result of obsessive thoughts. They may also engage in extensive rituals in an attempt to reduce the anxiety caused by obsessions. In the newest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), OCD was moved to its own disorder class of \"Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.\" Related conditions in the class include body-dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, and trichotillomania. Symptoms of OCD usually appear gradually and can be long-lasting if not treated. People with OCD may experience symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both. Such symptoms interfere with many areas of life including school, work, relationships, and normal daily functioning. Obsessions are thoughts, images, or ideas that won't go away, are unwanted, and are extremely distressing or worrying (\"What if I become infected with a deadly disease?\" or \"What if I hurt someone?\"). Some common symptoms of obsessions include: Compulsions are behaviors that have to be done over and over again to relieve anxiety. Compulsions are often related to obsessions. For example, if you are obsessed with being contaminated, you might feel compelled to wash your hands repeatedly. However, this is not always the case. It is important to be aware that not all habits or repetitive behaviors are synonymous with compulsions. Everyone has repeated thoughts or engages in double-checking things from time to time. In order to be diagnosed with OCD, their experience is characterized by: OCD is a relatively common disorder that by some estimates about 2.3% of people over their lifetime. It is experienced equally by men and women and affects all races and cultures. OCD usually begins around late adolescence/young adulthood, although young children and teenagers can also be affected. Parents and teachers often miss OCD in young children and teenagers, as they may go to great lengths to hide their symptoms. The exact causes of OCD are not known, but there are a few factors that are believed to play a role. People who are vulnerable to OCD describe a strong need to control their thoughts and may believe that their obsessive thoughts mean they are going crazy or will lose control. While many people can have recurrent, strange or unusual thoughts when feeling stressed, if you are vulnerable to OCD, it may be difficult to ignore or forget about these thoughts. In fact, because these thoughts seem so dangerous, you end up paying even more attention to them, which sets up a vicious cycle. Obsessive-compulsive disorder can present in a few different ways. Some people experience only obsessions, more commonly people experience both obsessions and compulsions, even if the compulsive behavior is only mental. There are no official subtypes of OCD, but research suggests that the most common obsessions and compulsions tend to center on certain themes: Parents should also be aware of a subtype of OCD in children triggered by certain infections such as strep throat, in which the child's own immune system attacks the brain. Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders (PANDAS) associated with streptococcal infections by some estimates may account for up to 25% of the children who have OCD. Unlike normal OCD, which develops slowly, in contrast to other forms of OCD, PANDAS OCD develops quickly and has a variety of other symptoms associated with it. Treatments for OCD may include medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. There are a variety of medications that are effective in reducing the frequency and severity of OCD symptoms.

  "summary": "Kecanduan dan gangguan obsesif-kompulsif (OCD) adalah gangguan kesehatan mental yang ditandai dengan pikiran obsesif dan perilaku kompulsif yang mengganggu kehidupan sehari-hari. Pikiran obsesif adalah ide, gambar, atau pikiran yang muncul secara tidak diinginkan, menyebabkan kecemasan dan ketegangan, seperti khawatir akan terpapar penyakit atau merusak orang lain. Perilaku kompulsif adalah tindakan yang harus dilakukan berulang kali untuk mengurangi kecemasan, seperti mencuci tangan secara berlebihan karena khawatir terpapar kuman. Meskipun banyak orang memiliki kebiasaan atau memeriksa hal-hal secara teratur, OCD terjadi ketika ini mengganggu fungsi sehari-hari, seperti kehidupan keluarga, pekerjaan, atau sekolah. Dalam klasifikasi DSM-5, OCD dikelompokkan sebagai kelompok gangguan \"Obsesif-Kompulsif dan Terkait\", yang juga mencakup gangguan seperti gangguan tubuh tidak sesuai, penyimpanan, dan rambut yang dipotong. Gangguan ini muncul secara perlahan dan dapat berlangsung lama jika tidak diobati. Kecemasan akibat pikiran obsesif sering menjadi penyebab utama dari kebutuhan untuk melakukan kompulsif. Namun, perlu diketahui bahwa tidak semua kebiasaan berulang merupakan kompulsif. OCD cukup umum, dengan perkiraan 2,3% populasi mengalami gangguan ini dalam hidupnya. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemahaman terhadap OCD dapat dilihat melalui prinsip tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa), di mana seseorang belajar mengendalikan pikiran dan memperbaiki kesadaran diri, serta memperkuat kepercayaan pada Allah sebagai bentuk perlindungan dari kecemasan dan gangguan mental.",
