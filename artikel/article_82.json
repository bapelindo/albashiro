  "content": "Dr. Amy Marschall is an autistic clinical psychologist with ADHD, working with children and adolescents who also identify with these neurotypes among others. She is certified in TF-CBT and telemental health. Yolanda Renteria, LPC, is a licensed therapist, somatic practitioner, national certified counselor, adjunct faculty professor, speaker specializing in the treatment of trauma and intergenerational trauma. Crisis intervention is a short-term (usually single session) technique used to address an immediate mental health emergency, stabilize the individual in crisis, and create and implement a safe, appropriate plan for next steps and future treatment. Although crisis intervention can be used in therapy if a client presents in an emergency, crisis hotlines also offer this service using appropriately trained volunteers or employees. A mental health crisis can occur for many different reasons. By definition, we often do not know when a crisis may occur, and we might not be able to wait for a regularly-scheduled therapy appointment or standard business hours to address it. When a person experiences a highly-stressful or traumatic event, they can go into crisis afterward because they cannot process what happened independently. Crisis intervention can help determine what they need to do to ensure their immediate safety, de-escalate their feelings, and make a plan for appropriate resources and ongoing treatment. If someone experienced a traumatic event a long time ago, they can still go into crisis if they are triggered in the present moment. Crisis intervention can help them return to the present moment, process the trigger, and manage their symptoms until they can connect with their treatment team. People with various mental health diagnoses, including mood disorders, psychotic disorders, or substance use disorders might experience a sudden, acute increase in their symptoms. They can benefit from crisis intervention to ensure immediate safety, utilize appropriate coping skills, and connect with ongoing treatment options. Someone who experiences suicidal ideation can experience a crisis if they feel that they might act on these thoughts. Crisis intervention addresses any specific triggers for these thoughts and manages the individual’s safety. Effective crisis intervention involves connecting to the person in crisis and talking them through specific steps to ensure their immediate safety as well as make appropriate plans for future care. Many crisis resources utilize a six-step model developed by Dr. Richard James. This model includes the following six steps: These steps help the client work through the emergency both in the moment and by taking steps to get further support in place in the future. Getting ongoing support in place can prevent future crises. Outpatient crisis intervention services can give clients the option to work through an immediate crisis in a safe environment without requiring hospitalization. It can assess risk level and connect clients to services that can help them in the moment. Typically, crisis intervention services are free to use and therefore accessible to anyone regardless of income or financial means. Phone and text-based crisis hotlines allow clients to access services from anywhere because they do not have to travel to a specific location to access support. Research has shown consistent outcomes for both phone and text-based hotlines. When clients have access to crisis resources that they can use at any time, they can sometimes avoid a higher level of care or hospitalization for mental health needs. Crisis support can provide a safety net for the client in between their other treatments. Let's take a look at some potential risks of crisis intervention. Crisis intervention only addresses the immediate emergency and is not a substitute for therapy services. While most crisis hotlines are free to use, it can be difficult for people in rural areas or those with low income to access an...",
  "summary": "Intervensi krisis adalah pendekatan singkat, biasanya dalam satu sesi, yang dirancang untuk menangani keadaan darurat mental, memastikan keamanan individu, dan mengatur rencana pengobatan selanjutnya. Dijelaskan oleh Dr. Amy Marschall, seorang psikolog klinis dengan autisme dan ADHD, serta Yolanda Renteria, terapis yang ahli dalam perawatan trauma, intervensi krisis sangat penting saat seseorang mengalami kejadian traumatis atau stres tinggi yang tidak dapat diproses secara mandiri. Kondisi krisis bisa muncul baik karena peristiwa traumatis baru maupun reaksi terhadap rangsangan saat ini, terutama pada individu dengan gangguan mental seperti gangguan mood, gangguan psikotik, atau gangguan penggunaan zat. Intervensi ini bertujuan untuk menstabilkan perasaan, menghentikan peningkatan gejala, dan membantu individu kembali ke keadaan saat ini. Dalam konteks psikologi islam, konsep tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) juga relevan, karena krisis sering kali mencerminkan kebutuhan akan kembali ke keseimbangan spiritual dan emosional. Dengan bantuan profesional, individu dapat mengenali kebutuhan mereka, mengelola gejala, dan membangun rencana jangka panjang untuk perawatan. Intervensi krisis juga tersedia melalui layanan darurat, seperti hotline, yang dilakukan oleh tenaga profesional terlatih. Meskipun singkat, keberhasilan intervensi ini sangat penting untuk mencegah eskalasi kondisi dan memastikan akses ke perawatan lanjutan. Dalam konteks Islam, kesehatan mental juga merupakan bagian dari keseimbangan hidup, yang harus dijaga melalui keberanian, kesabaran, dan kepercayaan pada Allah.",
