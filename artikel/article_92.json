Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. The term psychological disorders is sometimes used to refer to what are more frequently known as mental disorders or psychiatric disorders. Mental disorders are patterns of behavioral or psychological symptoms that impact multiple areas of life. These disorders create distress for the person experiencing the symptoms. The DSM-5-TR lists hundreds of distinct conditions. Anxiety and depression are among the most common types of mental health conditions that people experience. While the DSM provides diagnostic information about such conditions, including the age at which they typically appear, it does not provide guidelines for treatment or predictions related to the course of illness. While not a comprehensive list of every mental disorder, the following list includes some of the major categories of disorders described in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and the fifth edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR). The DSM is one of the most widely used systems for classifying mental disorders and provides standardized diagnostic criteria. We've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, Betterhelp, and Regain. Find out which option is the best for you. Neurodevelopmental disorders are those that are typically diagnosed during infancy, childhood, or adolescence. These psychological disorders include: Sometimes called intellectual disability, this type of developmental disorder originates prior to the age of 18 and is characterized by limitations in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviors. Limitations to intellectual functioning are often identified through the use of IQ tests, with an IQ score under 70 often indicating the presence of a limitation. Adaptive behaviors are those that involve practical, everyday skills such as self-care, social interaction, and living skills. This diagnosis is for developmental disabilities in children who are under the age of five. Such delays relate to cognition, social functioning, speech, language, and motor skills. It is generally seen as a temporary diagnosis applying to kids who are still too young to take standardized IQ tests. Once children reach the age where they are able to take a standardized intelligence test, they may be diagnosed with an intellectual development disorder. These disorders are those that impact the ability to use, understand, or detect language and speech. The DSM-5 identifies four different subtypes of communication disorders: language disorder, speech sound disorder, childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering), and social (pragmatic) communication disorder. Autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social interaction and communication in multiple life areas as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors. The DSM specifies that symptoms of autism spectrum disorder must be present during the early developmental period and that these symptoms must cause significant impairment in important areas of life including social and occupational functioning. ADHD is characterized by a persistent pattern of hyperactivity and impulsivity and/or inattention that interferes with functioning and presents itself in two or more settings such as at home, work, school, and social situations. The DSM-5 specifies that several of the symptoms must have been present prior to the age of 12 and that these symptoms must have a negative impact on social, occupational, or academic functioning. Bipolar disorder is characterized by shifts in mood as well as changes in activity and energy levels. The disorder often involves exper...",
  "summary": "Disorder psikologis dibagi ke dalam beberapa kategori utama, seperti gangguan neurodevelopmental, gangguan psikologis, gangguan kognitif, gangguan emosional, dan gangguan perilaku. Klasifikasi ini terutama berdasarkan *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (DSM-5-TR), yang merupakan sistem standar untuk mengklasifikasikan gangguan mental. Gangguan seperti kecemasan dan depresi merupakan yang paling umum dialami oleh individu. Meskipun DSM-5-TR menyediakan kriteria diagnosis dan usia munculnya gangguan, sistem ini tidak memberikan panduan perawatan atau prediksi perkembangan penyakit. Kategori gangguan neurodevelopmental biasanya didiagnosis pada masa bayi, anak, atau remaja, dan mencakup gangguan seperti disabilitas kognitif yang muncul sebelum usia 18 tahun, dengan karakteristik terbatasnya fungsi kognitif dan perilaku adaptif. Selain itu, gangguan lain seperti gangguan kecemasan, gangguan depresi, gangguan bipolar, gangguan kecanduan, dan gangguan perilaku juga termasuk dalam kategori utama. Meskipun tidak mencakup semua gangguan, daftar ini memberikan gambaran tentang kategori besar dari gangguan mental. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemahaman tentang kondisi mental ini dapat diperkuat melalui prinsip *tazkiyatun nufus* (perbaikan jiwa), yaitu memperkuat akidah, kebaikan, dan keseimbangan emosi. Ini menekankan pentingnya kehidupan batin yang sehat, yang sejalan dengan nilai-nilai agama dalam memelihara kesejahteraan mental. Dengan memadukan pendekatan psikologis dan nilai-nilai agama, individu dapat menghadapi gangguan mental secara lebih holistik dan berkelanjutan.",
