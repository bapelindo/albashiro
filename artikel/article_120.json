She specializes in relationships, anxiety, trauma and grief. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. The symptoms of schizophrenia can seem peculiar to people who observe them. Some common symptoms of schizophrenia include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized behavior, lack of emotion, reduced and disorganized speech, and memory problems. However, when people are experiencing symptoms, they may have little or no insight that their thoughts or behaviors are strange. The lack of insight can make schizophrenia very frustrating and frightening for loved ones. Schizophrenia is classified as a psychotic disorder, meaning a person becomes disconnected from reality. This disconnect will affect some combination of a person's perceptions, thought processes, beliefs, and emotions. These symptoms may come and go episodically. Schizophrenia usually develops in three phases: 1) A prodromal phase when changes in thoughts, feelings, and perceptions begin 2) An acute phase when psychotic symptoms appear 3) A recovery phase where support, medication, and therapy aid in improving the condition The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR) is a clinical resource practitioners use to diagnose mental health conditions. As with other conditions, there are specific clinical criteria involving symptoms and course of illness, that need to be met for someone to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Symptoms of schizophrenia are referred to as positive or negative. That doesn't mean that some are good and some are bad. Positive symptoms are those that are present in someone with schizophrenia that someone without schizophrenia or another mental health condition would not experience. Examples of these symptoms include: Delusions are fixed, false beliefs that don’t make sense in the context of a person’s culture. Although everyone has distorted beliefs from time to time, people with psychotic delusions can’t be convinced that their beliefs aren’t real. Hallucinations are false sensory experiences that have no basis in the external world. Psychotic hallucinations occur when the person is fully awake and not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and visual hallucinations (seeing things) are the most common, but a person can hallucinate a touch (for example, bugs crawling on the skin), taste, or smell. Disorganized speech is also known as \"loose association.\" In psychotically disorganized speech, words are not linked together based on the normal rules of language but may be strung together based on sounds, rhyme, puns, or free associations. Although everyone makes speech errors, especially when they're tired or stressed, disorganized speech during a schizophrenic episode is severely abnormal. It can be difficult or impossible to understand. Disorganized behaviors for someone with schizophrenia are not goal-directed and don’t make sense in context. For example, while taking one’s clothes off to take a bath is sensible, taking one’s clothes off on a public bus is an example of disorganized behavior. Laughing at inappropriate times or for no reason is a disorganized behavior. Adopting strange postures or freezing can be examples of catatonic behaviors. In addition to the positive symptoms that become present in someone with schizophrenia, others are referred to as negative symptoms. This means that the person is experiencing an absence or reduction of certain traits typically present in healthier individuals. The term negative suggests that something feels as if it is being taken away or disappearing from the person's daily experience. Examples of negative symptoms can include things like: People with flattened affect appear emotionless or have ...",
  "summary": "Skizofreni adalah gangguan psikotik yang menyebabkan seseorang terputus dari kenyataan, memengaruhi persepsi, pikiran, keyakinan, dan perasaan. Gejala umumnya meliputi halusinasi, kepercayaan palsu (delusi), perilaku tidak teratur, kurangnya emosi, pembicaraan yang tidak jelas, dan masalah memori. Salah satu hal yang membuat skizofreni sulit dikenali adalah kurangnya kesadaran pasien terhadap gejala-gejala aneh yang dialami. Skizofreni berkembang melalui tiga fase: fase prodromal (perubahan kecil dalam pikiran dan perasaan), fase akut (munculnya gejala psikotik), dan fase pemulihan dengan bantuan terapi, obat, dan dukungan. Menurut DSM-5-TR, diagnosis skizofreni memerlukan kriteria klinis spesifik terkait gejala dan perkembangan kondisi. Gejala dibagi menjadi dua kategori: gejala positif dan negatif. Gejala positif adalah hal yang tidak dialami oleh orang sehat, seperti halusinasi atau delusi. Gejala negatif meliputi kehilangan emosi, kurangnya motivasi, atau penurunan fungsi sosial. Karena pasien sering tidak menyadari keanehan perasaan atau pikiran mereka, keluarga atau teman dekat sering merasa bingung dan cemas. Pengenalan dini dan intervensi dini sangat penting untuk memperbaiki hasil. Terapi, obat, dan dukungan sosial menjadi kunci dalam proses pemulihan dan pengelolaan kondisi ini.",
