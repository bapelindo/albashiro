The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a handbook that provides guidelines for clinicians who diagnose psychiatric illnesses. Each condition is categorized and given a clear set of criteria that must be met for a diagnosis to be made. The latest edition, commonly known as the DSM-5, was released by the American Psychiatric Association on May 18, 2013. It replaced the DSM-IV, which had been in use since 1994. As is the case with each new edition of the DSM, there were some changes made to the diagnostic criteria for certain disorders from the DSM-IV to DSM-5, including depression. Some disorders have been removed, while others have been modified or added. The following is a look at how depression is diagnosed including an overview of the changes that came with the DSM-5 and what those changes mean for healthcare providers and patients. Depression is a common mental health disorder. Approximately 1 in 5 U.S. adults have received a diagnosis of depression in their lifetime. If you are concerned that you may be experiencing symptoms of depression, it's essential that you reach out to a medical or mental health professional. While there are online resources, screenings, and quizzes, they do not always come from reliable sources and cannot definitively diagnose any medical or mental health condition. However, you may find it helpful to use an online quiz or screening tool to assess your symptoms and organize them to take to your doctor or therapist. Having this information on hand can help you broach the topic of depression. The online questionnaires will ask you about your life and your feelings. Often, they take the form of a checklist with many \"Yes\" or \"No\" questions that you check off if they apply to you. For example, you may be asked to check a box if the following questions are true for you: While there is an abundance of self-tests for depression on the internet, they don't all come from reputable sources. You will not be able to self-diagnose a medical or mental health condition with a quiz or checklist, but these online tools can help you initiate a conversation with your doctor or therapist. Some questionnaires will ask you to rate your responses to a statement on a numerical scale. At one end, a 0 might indicate that a statement does not apply to you at all, and at the other end, a 10 might indicate that the statement applies to you all the time. For example, you might be asked to rate how much you identify with the following statements by selecting a number from 0 to 10, where 0 means \"Never\" and 10 means \"Always.\" Screening tools may also ask personal questions about your habits and lifestyle, such as whether you are married, go to work or school, or use substances. A medical or mental health professional will also ask you these types of questions to help assess for possible contributions to depression, such as the loss of a spouse or job or the use of alcohol or drugs. Medical and mental health professionals use established, research-backed guidelines, screening tools, checklists, and other criteria to help them make a diagnosis of depression.﻿ A provider can use these tools to guide them through observing and talking to a person who might be experiencing symptoms of depression. For example, taking note of whether a person is showered and appropriately dressed, the tone and speed of their speech, and other aspects of their appearance and demeanor can provide clues. Asking direct questions about a person's day-to-day life and their feelings can also provide valuable insight into the cause of a person's depressive symptom...",
  "summary": "Depresi merupakan gangguan kesehatan mental yang sangat umum, dengan sekitar 1 dari 5 orang dewasa di Amerika Serikat pernah menerima diagnosis depresi. Diagnosis depresi menurut DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edisi kelima) dilakukan oleh profesional kesehatan mental berdasarkan kriteria yang jelas dan terstruktur. DSM-5, yang diterbitkan pada tahun 2013 oleh American Psychiatric Association, menggantikan edisi sebelumnya (DSM-IV) dengan perubahan pada kriteria diagnosis, termasuk depresi. Perubahan ini mencakup penyesuaian pada definisi gejala, pengelompokan gangguan, serta penambahan atau penghapusan kondisi tertentu. Meskipun kriteria lebih terstruktur, penting untuk memahami bahwa penggunaan alat online seperti kuis atau screening hanya untuk mengevaluasi gejala dan membantu mempersiapkan diskusi dengan profesional, bukan sebagai diagnosis resmi. Karena itu, penggunaan alat tersebut tidak dapat menggantikan konsultasi langsung dengan dokter atau terapis. Kondisi depresi harus dikonfirmasi oleh profesional yang terlatih. Nancy Schimelpfening dan Steven Gans, ahli kesehatan mental, menekankan pentingnya pengenalan gejala dan pengakuan terhadap keadaan ini. Kebanyakan orang mengalami gejala depresi, namun hanya dengan bantuan profesional, diagnosis dan perawatan dapat dilakukan secara tepat. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, depresi juga dapat dipahami melalui prinsip tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa), di mana perbaikan diri, ibadah, dan keseimbangan emosional menjadi kunci pemulihan. Oleh karena itu, perawatan depresi harus melibatkan pendekatan holistik, baik secara medis maupun spiritual.",
