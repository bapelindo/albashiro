Another school year is here, and to mark the occasion Verywell Mind surveyed 1,000 middle and high school teachers in the U.S. for our Mental Health in the Classroom Study. Teachers reported on their experiences handling mental health issues, strategies that work, and the kind of resources they need to support their students even more. The survey found that 81% say teachers feel responsible for their students' mental health, and another 77% believe it’s also their duty to teach students about mental health and relevant self-care strategies. A vast majority of respondents (89%) agree that they don't have enough resources at their disposal to help students deal with mental health issues. Teachers have long had a role in society that goes well beyond educating our kids, and a big part of that stems from how much they care about their students. The past few years have tested teachers’ resolve even further, leaving them trying to guide classrooms of kids through a global pandemic, the deleterious effects of social media, and a world that is increasingly complicated and often cruel. “There is so much pressure put on teachers today. They are the educator, moral compass, sometimes parents, and always the adults in the room,” says Dr. Tara Lindahl, a licensed clinical psychologist and regional psychotherapy director at Mindpath Health in California. “With so many years of ‘unprecedented times,’ teachers now see how our children’s mental health may be affected. We must remember that this was not part of their training and that they may be feeling out of scope.” Just over 75% of teachers who took part in the survey reported that their school does offer mental health training for educators, but those working in private schools are more likely to have access at 82%. As a whole, 77% of surveyed educators have previously received training to incorporate mental health awareness and strategies in their teaching. Training rates are higher among teachers who are millennial or younger at 81%, and 86% for private school teachers. Dr. Kristen Niemczyk-Kistner, a New Jersey-based social worker, is one of the mental health professionals facilitating training for teachers (and parents). Last year, she created and facilitated a pilot training program for staff at the middle school where she works. Niemczyk-Kistner then made weekly psycho-education lesson plans for the teachers to go over with students each Friday during an extended homeroom. They were also given the vocabulary to create a safe, open space for students to discuss their well-being. Furthermore, the school made “Calming Spaces” for each grade filled with sensory items and comfortable furniture like bean bags. Niemczyk-Kistner reports that administrators, teachers, and students alike positively responded to the pilot program. Some survey participants have used techniques similar to those laid out by Niemczyk-Kistner: “Mental health awareness strategies are important in making students feel safe in my classroom. I try to take time for at least ten minutes every class period to focus on mental health by discussing their needs and struggles.” Overall, millennial and younger teachers felt both more responsible and more equipped to discuss mental health with their students, suggesting a generational divide in our feelings about mental health. However, many teachers feel that they don’t have enough resources to properly care for students or avenues to point them towards. As one participant explained, “We need to be adequately trained to not only spot, but to quickly intervene with students who need help, in providing a safe and comfortable space where students can share their thoughts and struggles and know that we can guide them to resources that will help them through their pain, wi...",
  "summary": "Sebanyak 9 dari 10 guru di Amerika Serikat menganggap bertanggung jawab atas kesehatan mental siswa, dengan 81% merasa harus membantu siswa dalam hal kesehatan mental, serta 77% percaya bahwa mereka juga harus mengajarkan strategi self-care. Namun, sebanyak 89% guru menyatakan tidak memiliki cukup sumber daya untuk mendukung siswa menghadapi masalah mental. Guru-guru saat ini berperan sebagai pendidik, penjaga moral, bahkan seperti orang tua, terutama dalam kondisi sulit seperti pandemi, dampak media sosial, dan dunia yang semakin kompleks. Dr. Tara Lindahl, konsultan psikolog, menyebut bahwa guru sering merasa terbebani karena tugas mereka melampaui pelajaran, dan mereka tidak dilatih secara khusus untuk menangani masalah kesehatan mental siswa. Meski 75% guru menyebut ada pelatihan kesehatan mental di sekolah, guru di sekolah swasta lebih terpapar dengan akses pelatihan ini (82%). Namun, secara keseluruhan, kebutuhan akan dukungan dan sumber daya yang memadai masih sangat besar. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, hal ini menegaskan pentingnya tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan diri—dalam kehidupan guru, karena guru harus memperbaiki dirinya terlebih dahulu agar bisa menjadi teladan dalam membimbing siswa. Dengan memperkuat kesehatan mental diri sendiri, guru dapat lebih efektif dalam membentuk karakter dan kehidupan yang sehat bagi murid-muridnya.",
