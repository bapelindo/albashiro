  "content": "The fear of missing out is becoming more common with the rise of social media. Learn about the connection between mental health and FOMO and tips for coping. Fear of missing out (FOMO) involves anxiety and unease about how others might be having more rewarding experiences than you. FOMO isn’t unique to the online world. You might feel it when friends at the dinner table tell you about an exciting vacation they’re about to go on. However, social media usage tends to worsen FOMO. That’s because, at any time of day or night, you can scroll through your feed and fixate on what’s happening in the world and what other people are doing without you. FOMO can show up in many different ways. It can be a fleeting thought that enters your mind after seeing something you wish you were a part of—a video of a concert, for example, or a picture of a wedding or graduation party. Or it can manifest as an urge to compulsively check your phone for notifications and updates. You might sit alone, feeling envious about how much fun others are having as you scroll through your feed, only to later realize how much time has passed you by. If this sounds like you, you’re certainly not alone in these habits. In fact, you probably know lots of people who always seem to be glued to their phones, whether in class, at work, or on a date. A fear of missing out can distract you from the present moment, and have a significant impact on your well-being. It can lead you to neglect self-care, relationships, and work or school responsibilities. It can also trigger negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness. No matter how you experience FOMO, there are steps you can take to make it more manageable and less disruptive in your daily life. Start by understanding the psychology of FOMO, and then take steps to overcome the negativity it creates in your life. People are social animals and we’re hardwired to fear exclusion. For early humans, being included in group activities like hunting was necessary for survival. This is why rejection can be such a painful experience; the brain is wired to seek a sense of belonging and acceptance by others. The fear of missing out is a product of that instinctual craving for inclusion. Today, we live in a world of extreme interconnectivity. There’s always access to information through the internet and social media. So, there’s always a chance to compare your life to someone else’s, and always a chance to observe events that you’re missing out on. What you’re missing may not be a matter of life or death—a friend’s birthday party, a travel opportunity—but it still makes you feel excluded. And seeing the highlight reel of another person’s life can make you feel envious and inadequate, even if those posts don’t reflect reality. Despite how it’s often casually used nowadays as a slang term, FOMO can have serious mental health consequences. Some research shows that excessive social media usage and FOMO can contribute to anxiety. The desire to constantly say “in the loop” keeps you from enjoying life. Instead, you spend more time ruminating about what you’re missing, and that leaves you feeling stressed. FOMO can also fuel depressive symptoms and weigh down your self-esteem. You might constantly compare your life with the idealized lives that other people present on social media—seemingly always out, always having fun. You begin to believe that you don’t measure up to your peers. FOMO can also have a two-way relationship with other negative feelings, such as boredom and loneliness. If you’re feeling lonely, or bored by a task at work or school, for example, it can amplify your feelings of FOMO. At the same time, experiencing FOMO from observing the lives of other people on social media can deepen your sense of loneliness, or make a boring task seem even worse. FOMO can also impact your behavior by creating a cycle of unhealthy habits that worsen your emotional well...",
  "summary": "Ketakutan terlewat (FOMO) semakin umum akibat peningkatan penggunaan media sosial. FOMO adalah perasaan cemas dan ketidaknyamanan bahwa orang lain memiliki pengalaman lebih menyenangkan daripada Anda. Meskipun FOMO bukan hanya terjadi di dunia maya, media sosial memperparah perasaan ini karena memungkinkan Anda terus memeriksa feed secara terus-menerus, membandingkan diri dengan kehidupan orang lain. Ini bisa berupa pikiran singkat setelah melihat video konser atau gambar perayaan, hingga kecanduan memeriksa ponsel untuk update terbaru. Perasaan ini dapat mengganggu kehadiran saat ini, menyebabkan Anda mengabaikan perawatan diri, hubungan, dan tanggung jawab sehari-hari. FOMO juga memicu emosi negatif seperti kecemasan, depresi, dan kesepian. Dalam psikologi, FOMO terkait dengan sifat sosial manusia—kita sebagai makhluk sosial cenderung merasa terancam jika tidak termasuk dalam aktivitas kelompok. Untuk mengatasi FOMO, penting untuk memahami akar psikologisnya. Langkah pertama adalah menyadari bahwa FOMO bukan hanya soal media sosial, tapi juga perasaan ingin terlibat dan diakui. Solusi termasuk membatasi waktu penggunaan ponsel, mempraktikkan kesadaran diri, dan fokus pada aktivitas yang bermakna. Dengan mengganti kecemasan terhadap kehilangan kesempatan dengan kegiatan sehari-hari yang bermakna, Anda dapat memperbaiki kesehatan mental dan memperkuat hubungan sosial. FOMO bisa dikendalikan dengan kesadaran, disiplin, dan komitmen terhadap kehidupan nyata.",
