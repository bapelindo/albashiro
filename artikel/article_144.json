The isolation and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic limited the physical and social activities of the population, which contributed to the increased prevalence of mental disorder. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental illnesses conferring a serious impact on individuals' life quality. This review summarizes the mental health consequences of COVID-19, especially for depression and anxiety. Exercise as an intervention for anxiety and depression has been demonstrated in both of the animal studies and human clinical trials. The underlying mechanism including the regulation on the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), D-β-hydroxybutyrate, synaptic transmission, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, tryptophan hydroxylase, GSK3β/β-catenin pathway, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and PGC-1α1-PPAR axis. In addition, we summarized the exercise strategies to fight against anxiety and depression according to the information from American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), World Health Organization and recent literatures about physical exercise during COVID-19. Since the first coronavirus infection (COVID-19) case reported in Dec 2019, the COVID-19 continue to emerge and represent a serious issue to public health (1). In the past several months, increased number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths, stay-at-home restriction and tons of information about COVID-19 inevitably conferred impact on people's mental health, especially for people already living with mental disorder (2). According to a perspective article published in the New England Journal of Medicine, depression and anxiety may develop to be side effects of COVID-19 after the Covid-19 Pandemic (3). However, the medical care required to large number of COVID-19 cases induced the currently ignorance regarding public mental health during the coronavirus pandemic (1, 3). According to previous studies, more than 50% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) experienced varying degrees of mental disorder after the outbreak of SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2015 (1, 4), indicating widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases were usually closely related to the increased prevalence of mental disorders (5). Among these disorders, anxiety and depression are the most common mental illnesses conferring a serious impact on individuals' life quality (6). Researchers in China investigated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 during the initial stage of coronavirus and found a high percent of the respondents with moderate to severe depressive (16.5%) and anxiety (28.8%) symptoms (7). Although emergency psychological crisis interventions has been performed to reduce the mental impact induced by COVID-19, changings to the public mental health still exist (8). The beneficial effect of exercise on improving physical health and fighting disease has be widely studied (9, 10). A large body of evidence suggested regular exercise could significantly reduce the risk of depression, anxiety and considered to be beneficial in the prevention of about 25 conditions (11–14). Furthermore, physical inactivity has been considered as a modifiable risk factor for numerous diseases including depression and anxiety (15). Here, we reviewed the recent studies concerning mental health related to COVID-19 coronavirus and the beneficial role of exercise against anxiety and depression. Exercise type, exercise frequency, exercise intensity and the underlying mechanism will be discussed.

  "summary": "Artikel ini membahas manfaat latihan fisik dalam mengatasi depresi dan kecemasan selama pandemi COVID-19. Karena isolasi dan pembatasan sosial, kasus gangguan mental, terutama depresi dan kecemasan, meningkat. Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa latihan fisik efektif sebagai intervensi untuk mengurangi gejala depresi dan kecemasan, baik dalam studi hewan maupun klinis manusia. Mekanisme ini melibatkan regulasi faktor neurotropik otak (BDNF), asam beta-hidroksibutirat, transmisi sinaptik, sistem HPA, jalur inflamasi, stres oksidatif, serta jalur PGC-1α1-PPAR. Latihan fisik membantu mengatur produksi zat yang mendukung kesehatan mental, seperti meningkatkan produksi BDNF yang penting bagi pertumbuhan neuron. Selain itu, latihan juga mengurangi aktivitas sistem HPA yang terkait dengan stres. Berdasarkan panduan dari American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), Organisasi Kesehatan Dunia (WHO), dan literatur terkini, strategi latihan seperti olahraga ringan, berjalan kaki, atau latihan aerobik secara teratur disarankan. Dalam konteks Islam, konsep *tazkiyatun nufus* (perbaikan jiwa) juga mendukung prinsip bahwa aktivitas fisik dan keseimbangan hidup membantu menjaga kesehatan mental dan spiritual. Oleh karena itu, latihan fisik bukan hanya memperbaiki fisik, tetapi juga menjadi bagian dari perawatan mental, sesuai dengan nilai-nilai kehidupan seimbang dan kesehatan jiwa dalam Islam.",
