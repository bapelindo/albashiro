  "content": "Stress is a big issue for people in the modern world. Patients’ quality of life is negatively impacted by the development of numerous secondary disorders brought on by stress. With the help of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), patients can reclaim their quality of life by self-analysing and eliminating negative thoughts. This book summarises the practical application of CBT in clinical settings after studying various literature. This book is portable and can be used by dental practitioners of various specializations to help patients overcome dental fears, orofacial pain, neurovascular headaches, hypochondriasis, psychosomatic disorders like oral lichen planus, unhealthy habits such as tobacco smoking, and various health issues encountered in dental settings. Dr Abhilash Panwar earned his BDS from Subharti Dental College and Hospital in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India, and is now pursuing a Master’s degree in Dental Surgery in Oral Medicine and Radiology at the same institution. He is interested in CBT practice and began working in the field in 2021. Dr Swati Gupta completed her BDS in 2005 at the prestigious King George University of Dental Sciences, Lucknow, India, and her MDS in Oral Medicine and Radiology at the Government Dental College and Hospital, Ahmedabad, India, in 2011. She was awarded for the best original research by IAOMR in 2018 and for her dedicated services to student community as a teacher on in 2020 by Rotary Club, Meerut. Dr K. NAGARAJU completed his BDS at the Government Dental College and Hospital, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India, in 2002 and his MDS in Oral Medicine and Radiology at Rajiv Gandhi University, Bapuji Dental College and Hospital, Davangere, Karnataka, India, 2006. He was awarded the best community service award in 2019 at a National Conference. The Story Cookbook is a comprehensive collection of over 80 story-based activities. This easy-to-follow guide provides a treasure trove of techniques to apply and adapt. It is a must-read for consultants, educators, and leaders using storytelling for positive change. This overview of cultural memory theories explores how communities establish their identity—a process now challenged by the digital turn. The book presents arguments by the most important memory theorists and describes the most significant forms of cultural memory. What is the structure of conscious experience? This book argues it is narrative form. This allows us to communicate our experience, but more importantly, to make informed predictions about the future, assess potential threats, and take action to prevent their occurrence. Many topical tasks of logical analysis, such as forming and testing hypotheses or searching for inconsistencies in reasoning, are often outside the scope of standard logic courses. This book demonstrates two simple mathematical systems that model reasoning and solve these tasks. Inclusive hospitality counters the impersonal nature of online learning by creating a welcoming, safe, and engaging environment. This book provides a path and tools for faculty to welcome and instruct students in a powerful, transformative manner, valuing them as individuals. Uncover the hidden power of metaphor in the media. This collection reveals how manipulative framing in news and film shapes reality and offers fresh insights to help you decode bias and avoid being misled. Essential for any critical thinker. Why do some people avidly engage with science while others hate it? This book explores the ‘science identities’ of diverse people through their life stories, providing strategies for educators and parents to foster and support a lifelong journey with science. Using a variety of psychoanalytic and philosophical lenses, and using the Psychic River as a metaphor, Mathew asks the question of what it means “to learn” and “to teach”. He considers the joys and frustrations of lifelong learning, and what drives us to learn as we age. Cognitive science now...",
