Hannah has worked at Verywell Mind since 2022, and during that time, has overseen extensive testing of 55 different online therapy services and 27 online therapy directories, both for individuals and couples. This gives Hannah expertise in the online therapy field, where she uses the insights gained from over three years of testing to be able to knowledgeably recommend therapy services to a wide variety of therapy seekers. Hannah also uses her clinical experience to act as a subject matter expert for Verywell Mind articles about mental health conditions and services. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. The term “depression” gets thrown around a lot these days. But what’s the difference between feeling blue and having clinical depression? Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by episodes of persistent low mood. Most of the time, “clinical depression” refers to major depressive disorder. But there are other types of depression too, such as bipolar depression, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), formally diagnosed as major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, and postpartum depression, now formally diagnosed as major depressive disorder with peripartum onset - to name a few. Read on to learn more about the symptoms, types, and causes of clinical depression, as well as treatments available to tackle this common but nefarious condition. One of the well known symptoms of clinical depression is episodes of pervasive sadness. But you might not know that there are other significant symptoms of depression. In fact, there is a whole litany of symptoms that affect not just your mood but your sleep, your body, and how you think and behave. Depression can change your mood in myriad ways. Along with sadness, you might experience a loss of interest in things that used to bring you pleasure—this is called “anhedonia.” Suddenly, your favorite TV show can’t hold your attention, or you no longer get a boost of endorphins after your favorite running route. You might experience your life as flat. You might also feel hopeless, like nothing will ever improve, or you could feel overwhelmingly and inappropriately guilty about things that, ordinarily, would not warrant that level of guilt. In addition, you might experience a general sense of apathy—things don’t matter to you like they used to, and it might feel hard to get motivated at work or to pursue your hobbies. Anxiety also often goes hand-in-hand with depression. The combination of persistent worry and rumination with symptoms like low mood, anhedonia, and hopelessness can be a match made in hell. Another key element of clinical depression is how it affects your sleep. You might find that you are oversleeping or not sleeping enough—both can be signs of depression. Specifically, “early awakening” is common in those with depression. You might find yourself consistently waking up in the wee hours of the morning and not being able to fall back asleep. Insomnia and restless sleep—the inability to fall asleep and waking up over and over throughout the night—can also be hallmarks of depression. Ironically, getting enough sleep, and enough restful sleep at that, is one key to managing depression, making these symptoms that much more insidious. Depression can affect your appetite, causing you to behave in uncharacteristic ways. You might suddenly feel ravenous all the time, as though your hunger can never be satiated no matter how much you eat; or you might lose your appetite completely. Associated with these are changes to your body—you might gain or lo...",
  "summary": "Depresi klinis bukan sekadar perasaan sedih atau \"merasa sedih\", melainkan gangguan kesehatan mental yang ditandai dengan keadaan mood rendah yang berkepanjangan. Kondisi ini dikenal sebagai gangguan depresi klinis, terutama dalam bentuk depresi mayor, namun juga mencakup jenis lain seperti depresi bipolar, depresi musiman (SAD), dan depresi pasca melahirkan. Gejala utamanya meliputi kehilangan semangat, kehilangan minat terhadap aktivitas sehari-hari, perubahan tidur dan makan, serta perasaan tidak berharga. Selain itu, depresi klinis juga dapat memengaruhi fungsi kognitif, seperti kesulitan fokus, memori, dan keputusan. Penyebabnya bisa bervariasi, termasuk faktor genetik, stres, kehilangan, atau gangguan biologis. Penanganannya meliputi terapi psikologis, obat, dan dukungan sosial. Dalam konteks Islam, konsep tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) dapat menjadi alat untuk mengatasi depresi, dengan memperkuat keimanan, ibadah, dan keberadaan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Kebiasaan seperti membaca al-Qur'an, berdoa, dan berinteraksi dengan keluarga dan komunitas dapat membantu memperbaiki suasana hati. Penting untuk memahami bahwa depresi bukan kelemahan, melainkan kondisi medis yang memerlukan perhatian dan perawatan. Dengan pemahaman yang benar, seseorang dapat mengelola depresi secara efektif dan memperbaiki kualitas hidup. (198 kata)",
