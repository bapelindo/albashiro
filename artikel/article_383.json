Her work spans various health-related topics, including mental health, fitness, nutrition, and wellness. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Depression is a mental health condition that affects one in six people at some point during their lifetime. It can take many different shapes and forms, and affect people in different ways. High-functioning depression or functional depression is a lay term that is sometimes used to describe experiencing symptoms of a depressive disorder, but to outside appearances, you look fine, says Aimee Daramus, PsyD, a licensed clinical psychologist. 'High-functioning' depression is not a term used in the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-5-TR), the tool that clinicians use to diagnose mental health conditions. Instead, it is a colloquial term that has gained popularity in recent years to describe hidden symptoms of depression that often go unnoticed by others and don't appear to impair day-to-day functioning. While it isn't a specifically-recognized condition, in some cases it may represent an actual clinical diagnosis of depression. You may seem fine because you can go about your day and be productive. Other people may not even realize that you are experiencing depression unless you tell them, says Dr. Daramus. However, you may not be alright. Despite the growing use of the term \"high-functioning depression,\" some experts suggest that its use can be problematic or even harmful. While the use of the term demonstrates how depression can often be an invisible illness, causing distressing symptoms without being outwardly visible, its use may also play a part in perpetuating stigma about mental illness. It may cause some people to feel that they should be able to function at a high level even while struggling with serious symptoms of depression. It's also important to emphasize that describing it as 'high-functioning' often makes it seems like the symptoms are less serious or less severe. This might increase the likelihood that people will dismiss their symptoms, feel like others won't take them seriously, or fail to seek treatment. Depression can cause emotional and physical symptoms, which can include: 'High functioning' depression can happen at any severity, from mild to so severe that the person is self-harming or at risk of suicide. However, they are often hiding their symptoms from other people. Someone who lives with you may notice the fatigue, irritability, isolation, sadness, and other signs of depression, says Dr. Daramus. “A lot of the time, though, people can’t really tell unless you choose to be open about it.” If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. Depression is usually caused by a combination of several factors, such as: It’s important to note that 'high-functioning' depression isn’t an official diagnosis in itself, says Dr. Daramus. It is sometimes used to describe dysthymia, but it can happen with any type of depressive disorder. According to Dr. Daramus, there are several types of depressive disorders and specifiers, including: A mental healthcare provider can determine whether your symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for these depressive and other psychiatric disorders listed in the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\" a guide published by the American Psychiatric Association. If you have symptoms of these depressive disorders, you may still be functioning on some level as though everything’s fine, but it may not be.

  "summary": "Depresi yang \"berfungsi tinggi\" atau depresi fungsional adalah istilah kasual yang digunakan untuk menggambarkan kondisi depresi yang menimbulkan gejala, namun tidak terlihat secara nyata oleh orang lain. Meskipun individu seperti Sanjana tampak sehat dan produktif, mereka mungkin mengalami gejala depresi seperti kehilangan semangat, kecemasan, atau kehilangan minat terhadap aktivitas sehari-hari. Istilah ini tidak terdaftar dalam DSM-5-TR, manual diagnosis mental, dan bukan diagnosis medis resmi. Namun, dalam beberapa kasus, kondisi ini bisa mencerminkan keadaan klinis nyata dari depresi. Dr. Aimee Daramus, psikolog klinis, menjelaskan bahwa orang mungkin terlihat sehat karena tetap bisa bekerja dan menjalani kehidupan sehari-hari, namun secara internal mereka mengalami perasaan berat. Meskipun istilah ini menggambarkan realitas bahwa depresi bisa tidak terlihat, penggunaannya juga dapat menimbulkan stigma. Beberapa ahli mempertanyakan manfaatnya, karena bisa membuat orang berpikir bahwa mereka harus \"berfungsi baik\" meski mengalami gejala serius. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, hal ini menekankan pentingnya tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan jiwa—dan kesadaran akan kebutuhan akan perawatan mental. Kondisi seperti ini menegaskan bahwa kesehatan mental harus diperhatikan secara pribadi, bukan hanya berdasarkan keberhasilan eksternal. Oleh karena itu, penting untuk mengenali gejala depresi, meminta bantuan profesional, dan memahami bahwa keberhasilan tidak selalu berarti kebahagiaan atau kesehatan mental.",
