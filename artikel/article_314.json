  "content": "Do you worry excessively or feel tense and anxious all day long? Learn about the signs, symptoms, and treatment of GAD. Everyone gets anxious sometimes, but if your worries and fears are so constant that they interfere with your ability to function and relax, you may have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is a common anxiety disorder that involves constant and chronic worrying, nervousness, and tension. Unlike a phobia, where your fear is connected to a specific thing or situation, the anxiety of GAD is diffused—a general feeling of dread or unease that colors your whole life. This anxiety is less intense than a panic attack, but much longer lasting, making normal life difficult and relaxation impossible. Generalized anxiety disorder is mentally and physically exhausting. It drains your energy, interferes with sleep, and wears your body out. If you have GAD you may worry about the same things that other people do, but you take these worries to a new level. A co-worker’s careless comment about the economy becomes a vision of an imminent pink slip; a phone call to a friend that isn’t immediately returned becomes anxiety that the relationship is in trouble. Sometimes just the thought of getting through the day produces anxiety. You go about your activities filled with exaggerated worry and tension, even when there is little or nothing to provoke them. Whether you realize that your anxiety is more intense than the situation calls for, or believe that your worrying protects you in some way, the end result is the same. You can’t turn off your anxious thoughts. They keep running through your head, on endless repeat. But no matter how overwhelming things seem now, you can break free from chronic worrying, learn to calm your anxious mind, and regain your sense of hope. Worries, doubts, and fears are a normal part of life. It’s natural to be anxious about an upcoming test or to worry about your finances after being hit by unexpected bills. The difference between “normal” worrying and generalized anxiety disorder is that the worrying involved in GAD is: Not everyone with generalized anxiety disorder has the same symptoms, but most people experience a combination of emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms that often fluctuate, becoming worse at times of stress. In children, excessive worrying centers on future events, past behaviors, social acceptance, family matters, personal abilities, and school performance. Unlike adults with GAD, children and teens often don’t realize that their anxiety is disproportionate to the situation, so adults need to recognize their symptoms. Along with many of the symptoms that appear in adults, some red flags for GAD in children are: Support from other people is vital to overcoming GAD. Social interaction with someone who cares about you is the most effective way to calm your nervous system and diffuse anxiety, so it’s important to find someone you can connect with face to face on a regular basis—your significant other, a family member, or a friend, perhaps. This person should be someone you can talk to for an uninterrupted period of time, someone who will listen to you without judging, criticizing, or continually being distracted by the phone or other people. Build a strong support system. Human beings are social creatures. We’re not meant to live in isolation. But a strong support system doesn’t necessarily mean a vast network of friends. Don’t underestimate the benefit of a few people you can trust and count on to be there for you. Talk it out when your worries start spiraling. If you start to feel overwhelmed with anxiety, meet with a trusted family member or friend. Just talking face to face about your worries can make them seem less threatening. Know who to avoid when you’re feeling anxious. Your anxious take on life may be something you learned when you were growing up. If your mother is a chronic worrier, she is not the best person to call when you\ufffd\ufffd...",
  "summary": "Disorder kecemasan umum (GAD) adalah gangguan kecemasan yang ditandai dengan kecemasan berkepanjangan, ketegangan, dan perasaan cemas yang tidak berhenti. Perbedaannya dengan kecemasan terhadap hal khusus (phobia), kecemasan GAD bersifat umum—merupakan perasaan ketakutan atau ketegangan yang meliputi seluruh kehidupan. Meskipun intensitasnya kurang parah dibanding serangan kecemasan, durasinya sangat panjang, sehingga mengganggu fungsi sehari-hari dan membuat kesulitan untuk merasa tenang. Orang dengan GAD sering mengalami kecemasan terhadap hal-hal biasa, seperti komentar karyawan atau kehilangan hubungan, yang diperbesar menjadi kecemasan besar. Bahkan, hanya memikirkan hari itu bisa memicu kecemasan. Kecemasan ini tidak terkait dengan peristiwa nyata, namun tetap menghantui pikiran, membuat seseorang tidak bisa berhenti memikirkan hal tersebut. GAD membebani fisik dan mental, mengganggu tidur, menguras energi, dan mengurangi kualitas hidup. Meskipun kecemasan dan keraguan adalah hal normal dalam kehidupan, jika terjadi secara berlebihan dan berkepanjangan, maka perlu perhatian. Dengan perawatan yang tepat, seperti terapi kognitif perilaku dan terapi psikologis, seseorang dapat belajar mengelola pikiran, mengurangi kecemasan, dan memulai kembali perasaan harapan dan kepercayaan diri. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, GAD juga bisa dipahami melalui prinsip tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan jiwa—dengan memperkuat keimanan, memperbaiki akhlak, dan memperkuat kepercayaan diri melalui ibadah dan refleksi diri. Dengan cara ini, seseorang dapat menemukan ketenangan batin dan kembali ke kehidupan yang seimbang.",
