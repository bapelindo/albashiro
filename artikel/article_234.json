It fuels competition and sparks social connection. Its absence can lead to mental illnesses such as depression. Motivation encompasses the desire to continue striving toward meaning, purpose, and a life worth living. People often have multiple motives for engaging in any one behavior. Motivation might be extrinsic, whereby a person is inspired by outside forces—other people or rewards. Motivation can also be intrinsic, whereby the inspiration comes from within—the desire to improve at a certain activity. Intrinsic motivation tends to push people more forcefully, and the accomplishments are more fulfilling. One framework used for understanding motivation is the hierarchy of needs proposed by American psychologist Abraham Maslow in 1943. According to Maslow, humans are inherently motivated to better themselves and move toward expressing their full potential—self-actualization—by progressively encountering and satisfying several levels of need from the most fundamental, such as for food and safety, to higher-order needs for love, belonging, and self-esteem. Eventually, Maslow extended the theory to include a need for self-transcendence: People reach the pinnacle of growth and find the highest meaning in life by attending to things beyond the self. Although the universality of Maslow's theory has been challenged, many believe it captures fundamental truths about human motivation. Motivation can stem from a variety of sources. People may be motivated by external incentives, such as the motivation to work for compensation, or internal enjoyment, such as the motivation to create artwork in one’s spare time. Other sources of motivation include curiosity, autonomy, validation of one’s identity and beliefs, creating a positive self-image, and the desire to avoid potential losses. Intrinsic motivation is a drive that comes purely from within; it’s not due to any anticipated reward, deadline, or outside pressure. For example, people who are intrinsically motivated to run do so because they love the feeling of running itself, and it's an important part of their identity. Extrinsic motivation can increase motivation in the short term, but over time it can wear down or even backfire. By contrast, intrinsic motivation is powerful because it is integrated into identity and serves as a continuous source of motivation. Extrinsic motivation is any reason someone does work other than the joy of doing the work itself. Anything promised for completing the task or received as a result of completing the task are extrinsic motivators. An extrinsic motivator needs three elements to be successful, according to research by psychologist Victor Vroom: expectancy (believing that increased effort will lead to increased performance), instrumentality (believing that a better performance will be noticed and rewarded), and valence (wanting the reward that is promised). Achieving a goal is a process. And all of the components of that process deserve attention to ensure success, from setting the objective, to overcoming obstacles, to sustaining momentum until the project is complete. Failing to accomplish a goal is sometimes due to the way it was set. But a few psychological tricks can help set and reach those goals. One is to ensure that the goal is attached to a value, such as the value of supporting your local community or fighting climate change. Another is to frame your goal as an asset to be gained rather than a threat to be avoided. For example, instead of thinking, “I shouldn’t bother my boss, so we can avoid a rocky relationship,” try thinking, “I want to learn new communication skills to reset our relationship.” Yet another idea is to try setting a learning goal instead of a performance goal; instead of deciding to lose 20 pounds, decide to le...",
  "summary": "Motivasi adalah keinginan untuk bertindak demi mencapai tujuan, menjadi faktor utama dalam menetapkan dan mencapai tujuan seseorang. Ia mendorong perilaku manusia, memicu kompetisi, dan membangun koneksi sosial. Kurangnya motivasi dapat menyebabkan gangguan mental seperti depresi. Motivasi mencakup keinginan untuk terus berusaha menuju makna, tujuan, dan kehidupan yang bernilai. Motivasi bisa berasal dari luar (eksternal), seperti imbalan atau dorongan dari orang lain, atau dari dalam (intrasik), seperti keinginan untuk memperbaiki diri atau meningkatkan kemampuan. Motivasi intrinsik cenderung lebih kuat dan memberikan kepuasan yang lebih dalam. Salah satu kerangka pemahaman motivasi adalah hierarki kebutuhan oleh Abraham Maslow, yang menyatakan bahwa manusia secara alami ingin berkembang dan mencapai potensi penuh (self-actualization) melalui penuhinya kebutuhan mulai dari dasar seperti kebutuhan makan dan aman, hingga kebutuhan akan kasih sayang, keanggotaan, dan harga diri. Pada tahap tertinggi, manusia mencari makna di luar diri sendiri, yaitu self-transcendence. Meskipun teori Maslow belum sepenuhnya terbukti secara universal, banyak orang menganggap bahwa teori ini mencerminkan kebenaran dasar tentang motivasi manusia. Sumber motivasi juga bervariasi, termasuk imbalan eksternal, keinginan untuk berekspresi, rasa ingin tahu, kebebasan, pengakuan diri, dan keinginan untuk menghindari kerugian. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, motivasi juga terkait dengan tazkiyatun nufus, yaitu perbaikan diri melalui keimanan dan kebaikan, yang menjadi dasar dari kehidupan bermakna dan berkelanjutan.",
