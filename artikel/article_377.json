Lauri Rotko / Folio Images / Getty Images Psychosis is a loss of contact with reality, typically including delusions (false ideas about what is taking place or who you are) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there). It impacts the way that the brain processes information. When experiencing psychosis, people may hear, see, feel, or believe things that are not real. Psychosis is a symptom associated with a number of health conditions including the manic phase of bipolar I disorder, as well as schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizoaffective disorder. Other conditions where psychosis may be present include postpartum psychosis and depressive episodes. About 7 in every 1000 people experience psychosis at some time in their lives. Some forms of psychosis are brought on by a specific condition, such as: Psychosis can also be induced by illness or medication or caused by a medical condition, such as a brain tumor, brain disease, or brain infection. Psychosis in itself is a symptom of another problem, not its own illness. Symptoms of psychosis include: If you think you or someone you love is experiencing psychosis, it's important to seek medical treatment immediately. The earlier you get treatment and intervention, the better. Experiencing psychotic symptoms can be scary to both you and the people around you and may even cause you to hurt yourself or others. Not everyone has warning signs that a psychotic episode is coming, but some people do. These signs and symptoms can occur over several months and may fluctuate in both severity and type. This period of changing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors before a psychotic episode is called the prodromal phase. Symptoms of prodrome can include: The exact causes of psychosis are not entirely clear and each person's experience may be different. Physical problems that can cause psychosis include: Psychosis can also be caused by a mental health condition such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or depression. People are more likely to develop psychosis if they also have a close family member who has a psychotic disorder. Psychosis is a symptom of another health condition, not a diagnosis in and of itself. In order to determine what might be causing psychosis, a doctor will perform a physical and collect a medical history. They will also ask questions about the symptoms including its severity and duration. They will also want to know about any other symptoms that you might be experiencing. In some cases, your doctor may perform special tests in order to rule out medical conditions that may be causing your psychosis. Once your doctor has diagnosed what is causing your symptoms, they can recommend treatments that are best suited to your particular situation. Treating psychosis depends on the cause. Hospitalization may be necessary. If you have a disorder that involves psychosis, starting, or changing antipsychotics may also be helpful in keeping psychotic symptoms and episodes at bay. The older, first generation of antipsychotics are known as typical antipsychotics. They can be a very effective treatment but may have harsher side effects, such as tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal side effects. Common typical antipsychotics include: The newer, second-generation antipsychotics are called atypical antipsychotics and tend to have a lower risk for tardive dyskinesia and other movement disorders. Examples of common atypical antipsychotics include: Psychotherapy may be useful for dealing with cognitive symptoms of conditions such as schizophrenia and psychotic disorders. Psychotherapy can also be useful when people also have comorbid conditions such as anxiety or mood disorders.﻿﻿ If you are experiencing symptoms of psychosis, it is important to seek help immediately.

  "summary": "Psikosis adalah kehilangan kontak dengan realitas, yang biasanya mencakup delusi (keyakinan salah tentang kejadian atau identitas diri) dan halusinasi (mendengar atau melihat hal yang tidak ada). Gejala ini memengaruhi cara otak memproses informasi, membuat seseorang merasa mendengar, melihat, atau merasakan hal yang tidak nyata. Psikosis bukan penyakit sendiri, melainkan gejala dari berbagai kondisi kesehatan, seperti gangguan bipolar, schizofrenia, PTSD, kejang postpartum, atau episode depresi. Faktor fisik seperti tumor otak, penyakit otak, atau obat juga dapat menyebabkan psikosis. Kondisi ini dapat muncul secara tiba-tiba atau berkembang secara perlahan melalui fase prodromal, di mana perubahan pada pikiran, perasaan, dan perilaku terjadi selama beberapa bulan. Tanda-tanda prodromal bisa mencakup perubahan mood, kebingungan, atau kecemasan. Karena psikosis dapat menyebabkan bahaya bagi diri sendiri atau orang lain, penting untuk segera mencari perawatan medis. Penanganan dini sangat penting untuk menghentikan perkembangan gejala dan mencegah komplikasi. Meskipun tidak semua kasus memiliki tanda peringatan, beberapa individu dapat mengalami perubahan perilaku sebelum terjadi episode psikosis. Penyebab eksak psikosis masih belum sepenuhnya diketahui, namun kombinasi faktor genetik, lingkungan, dan gangguan neurologis mungkin berperan. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemahaman tentang psikosis dapat diperkuat melalui konsep tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa), yang menekankan pentingnya keseimbangan pikiran, kepercayaan, dan ketaatan terhadap Allah sebagai bentuk perlindungan mental. Dengan pendekatan holistik, psikosis dapat diatasi secara lebih baik melalui perawatan medis dan dukungan spiritual.",
