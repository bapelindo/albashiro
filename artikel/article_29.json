  "content": "Pandemics are large-scale epidemics that spread throughout the world. Virologists predict that the next pandemic could occur in the coming years, probably from some form of influenza, with potentially devastating consequences. Vaccinations, if available, and behavioral methods are vital for stemming the spread of infection. However, remarkably little attention has been devoted to the psychological factors that influence the spread of pandemic infection and the associated emotional distress and social disruption. Psychological factors are important for many reasons. They play a role in nonadherence to vaccination and hygiene programs, and play an important role in how people cope with the threat of infection and associated losses. Psychological factors are important for understanding and managing societal problems associated with pandemics, such as the spreading of excessive fear, stigmatization, and xenophobia that occur when people are threatened with infection. This book offers the first comprehensive analysis of the psychology of pandemics. It describes the psychological reactions to pandemics, including maladaptive behaviors, emotions, and defensive reactions, and reviews the psychological vulnerability factors that contribute to the spreading of disease and distress. It also considers empirically supported methods for addressing these problems, and outlines the implications for public health planning. Steven Taylor, PhD, is a Professor and Clinical Psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of British Columbia, Canada. He received his MSc from the University of Melbourne, and his PhD from the University of British Columbia. His research and clinical work has focused largely on anxiety disorders and related clinical conditions, including fears and phobias, health anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. He has authored over 300 scientific publications and more than 20 books, which have been translated into many languages. His books include Understanding and Treating Panic Disorder, Treating Health Anxiety, and Clinician’s Guide to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. He has also served as Editor and Associate Editor of several academic journals, including Behaviour Research and Therapy, Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy, and the Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders. He maintains a clinical practice in Vancouver, BC, specializing in mood and anxiety disorders. The Story Cookbook is a comprehensive collection of over 80 story-based activities. This easy-to-follow guide provides a treasure trove of techniques to apply and adapt. It is a must-read for consultants, educators, and leaders using storytelling for positive change. This book explores the human psyche (‘soul’) and its usefulness in a techno-scientific revolution that is often blind to its subject: the human being. It makes a strong intellectual case for the soul by examining consciousness, synchronicity, suffering, and death. Fractal dynamics provide a tool for understanding complexity. This book brings experts together to reconcile dichotomies like mind-brain and subjective-objective, bringing subjective experience into a scientific framework. What can we do about children who withdraw from loving care, or parents lost in the hurts of their own childhood? This book gathers 25 stories from 41 years in infant mental health, revealing how our earliest attachment experiences support or confound our later development. Synthesizing decades of research, this book explores innovations in teaching to enrich the lives of children. It offers practical strategies for educators and parents based on whole child development, creativity, and the power of play. Essential reading. This essential guide to the youth transgender crisis argues social contagion is a key factor in the upsurge. It exposes the perils of medicalization—from puberty blockers to hormones—and offers a vital psychotherapeutic path ...",
  "summary": "Buku *The Psychology of Pandemics* membahas aspek psikologis yang sering diabaikan dalam perang melawan wabah, seperti ketakutan, ketegangan, dan perilaku maladaptif yang memengaruhi penyebaran penyakit. Faktor psikologis berperan besar dalam ketidakpatuhan terhadap vaksinasi dan kebiasaan higienis, serta dalam cara masyarakat menghadapi ancaman infeksi dan kehilangan. Wabah dapat memicu fenomena seperti kecemasan berlebihan, stigmatisasi, dan xenofobia, yang memperparah situasi sosial dan emosional. Buku ini memberikan analisis komprehensif tentang reaksi psikologis terhadap wabah, termasuk emosi, respons defensif, dan faktor kepekaan psikologis yang mempercepat penyebaran penyakit dan stres. Penulis, Steven Taylor, seorang psikolog klinis dan profesor di Universitas British Columbia, memfokuskan penelitiannya pada gangguan kecemasan, kecemasan kesehatan, dan trauma. Dalam buku ini, ia mengusulkan metode berbasis bukti untuk mengatasi masalah psikologis tersebut, serta memberikan rekomendasi bagi perencanaan kesehatan publik. Buku ini penting karena menekankan bahwa keberhasilan dalam mengatasi wabah tidak hanya bergantung pada vaksinasi atau kesehatan fisik, tetapi juga pada pemahaman dan pengelolaan aspek psikologis masyarakat. Dengan memperhatikan faktor psikologis, pemerintah dan profesional kesehatan dapat merancang strategi yang lebih efektif dan manusiawi dalam menghadapi krisis wabah.",
