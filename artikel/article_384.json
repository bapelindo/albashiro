Unipolar depression is a term used interchangeably with major depressive order, and is characterized by continuous feelings of sadness, low mood, feelings of worthlessness, lack of interest in activities you used to enjoy, as well as suicidal ideation. Unipolar disorder is a serious mental health disorder affecting 8.4% of the U.S. population. The disorder is more prevalent among women than men, and among younger people (aged 18-25) than older people. In 2020, 14.8 million adults had a severe episode of unipolar disorder, and 66% of people with the disorder were treated. The term unipolar depression is used to distinguish major depressive disorder from bipolar disorder, which is characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression. Sometimes bipolar disorder is misdiagnosed as unipolar depression. In these cases, treatment is not successful, as treatment for the two disorders differs. Unipolar depression has distinct differences from bipolar disorder, including lack of manic/hypomanic episodes; however, depression is also a symptom of bipolar disorder. It’s important that if you are having signs of depression, you receive a proper diagnosis from a medical professional, who will determine if you are experiencing unipolar depression or bipolar depression. Experiencing unipolar depression, or major depressive disorder, is different from feeling sad and down from time to time. Unipolar depression is characterized by feelings of depression that are persistent, intense, and that make it challenging for you to function normally or relate to others. Some of the main characteristics of unipolar depression include: If you or a loved one are having thoughts of suicide, call 911 immediately or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. In order to receive a diagnosis of unipolar depression, you will need to be evaluated by a doctor or psychiatrist. Evaluations for depression often include a physical exam, a medical and family history questionnaire, and bloodwork to look for markers of disease. Sometimes other medical conditions are confused with unipolar depression, including thyroid or hormonal disorders, so it’s important to rule those out. According to the DSM-5-TR, in order to be diagnosed with unipolar depression (major depressive disorder), you need to have had symptoms of a depressive episode for two weeks or more, and experience five or more of the following symptoms: There are several factors that contribute to unipolar depression. Usually it’s not just one factor that causes the condition, but several taken together—a perfect storm of causes, so to speak. Some of the most common causes of unipolar depression include: Additionally, certain risks factors may make you more prone to developing unipolar depression, such as: It is difficult to live with unipolar depression, and you may find the diagnosis upsetting. But the silver lining is that unipolar depression is treatable.

  "summary": "Depresi unipolar, juga dikenal sebagai gangguan depresi utama, adalah kondisi mental serius yang ditandai dengan perasaan sedih yang berkepanjangan, rasa tidak bernilai, kehilangan minat terhadap aktivitas yang dulu menyenangkan, dan ide bunuh diri. Kondisi ini memengaruhi sekitar 8,4% populasi Amerika Serikat, lebih sering terjadi pada perempuan dan kelompok usia muda (18-25 tahun). Dalam tahun 2020, sekitar 14,8 juta orang dewasa mengalami episode berat depresi unipolar, dengan 66% menerima perawatan. Depresi unipolar dibedakan dari gangguan bipolar, yang memiliki siklus antara mania dan depresi. Kebanyakan orang dengan depresi unipolar tidak mengalami episode mania atau hipomania, yang menjadi kunci dalam diagnosis. Salah satu kesalahan umum adalah menganggap depresi sebagai bentuk bipolar, padahal pengobatan berbeda. Depresi unipolar bukan sekadar perasaan sedih sementara, melainkan kondisi yang berkepanjangan, intens, dan mengganggu fungsi sehari-hari serta hubungan sosial. Untuk mendapatkan diagnosis akurat, penting untuk berkonsultasi dengan profesional medis, karena perawatan yang salah dapat memperparah kondisi. Jika seseorang atau keluarga mengalami pikiran bunuh diri, segera hubungi layanan darurat seperti 911 atau layanan penanganan bunuh diri nasional 988. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, depresi harus dihadapi dengan keseimbangan spiritual, dengan memperkuat tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa) melalui ibadah, refleksi, dan dukungan sosial. Perawatan yang komprehensif mencakup terapi, obat, dan pendekatan spiritual untuk memulihkan kesehatan mental secara holistik.",
