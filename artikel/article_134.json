Keep reading to learn about each type of antidepressant, including how they work, their benefits and uses, and their potential side effects and risks. There are three basic molecules, known chemically as monoamines, believed to be involved in mood regulation. These primarily serve as neurotransmitters, which transmit nerve signals to their corresponding receptors in the brain. Antidepressants work by influencing neurotransmitters such as: In people with depression, the availability of these neurotransmitters in the brain is characteristically low. Antidepressants increase the availability of one or several of these neurotransmitters in different, distinctive ways. As the name implies, an antidepressant is a drug primarily used to treat depression. Depression is a common disorder that affects brain chemistry and function. Antidepressants can help correct the dysfunction by altering the circuits and chemicals that pass signals along nerve routes to the brain. Antidepressants are grouped into classes based on how they affect the chemistry of the brain. While the antidepressants in a class will tend to have similar side effects and mechanisms of action, there are differences in their molecular structures, which can influence how well the drug is absorbed, disseminated, or tolerated in different people. Of the five major types of antidepressants, SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed, particularly in first-line treatment. Other antidepressants may be used if these drugs fail or in cases of intractable depression, also referred to as treatment-resistant depression. There are a number of antidepressants that work by preventing the reabsorption (reuptake) of neurotransmitters into the body. Collectively known as reuptake inhibitors, they prevent the reuptake of one or more neurotransmitters so more are available and active in the brain. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) work by specifically inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin. SSRIs are a newer class of antidepressants first developed during the 1970s. Examples include: SSRIs tend to have fewer side effects than older antidepressants but are still known to cause side effects such as dry mouth, gastrointestinal issues, sexual dysfunction, and irregular heart rhythm. In addition to treating depression, SSRIs are also sometimes used to treat anxiety disorders, eating disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and premenstrual dysmorphic disorder. They have also proved helpful during stroke recovery. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) work in a similar way to SSRIs except that they inhibit the reuptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin. The first SNRI was FDA-approved in December of 1993. Increasing norepinephrine levels in tandem with serotonin levels can be particularly useful for people with psychomotor retardation (the slowing of physical movement and thought). Examples of SNRIs include: Common side effects of SNRIs include nausea, drowsiness, fatigue, constipation, and dry mouth. Some SNRIs, like Cymbalta, can also be...",
  "summary": "Obat antidepresan merupakan terapi penting dalam mengatasi gangguan depresi, yang terkait dengan ketidakseimbangan kimia di otak, khususnya pada neurotransmiter seperti serotonin, dopamin, dan norepinefrin. Ada lima jenis utama obat antidepresan, masing-masing bekerja dengan cara berbeda untuk meningkatkan ketersediaan neurotransmiter dalam otak. Beberapa jenis obat bekerja dengan menghambat penguraian molekul kimia, sementara yang lain meningkatkan jumlah molekul tersebut di otak. Pemilihan jenis obat tergantung pada gejala individu, riwayat pengobatan, dan gangguan psikologis lainnya. Meskipun obat ini efektif dalam mengatur fungsi kimia otak, mereka juga memiliki efek samping dan risiko, sehingga perlu dipantau oleh profesional kesehatan mental. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, perlu dipahami bahwa kesehatan mental bukan hanya soal obat, tetapi juga melibatkan tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan akhlak dan kebiasaan batin. Keseimbangan emosional, kepercayaan diri, dan ketahanan mental dapat diperkuat melalui praktik kehidupan sehari-hari yang bermakna, seperti ibadah, refleksi, dan pengelolaan emosi. Oleh karena itu, pengobatan antidepresan sebaiknya dikombinasikan dengan pendekatan psikologis dan spiritual, agar menciptakan keseimbangan antara fisik, mental, dan spiritual. Dengan demikian, individu dapat memperkuat kekuatan mental dan kestabilan emosional, sesuai dengan prinsip kehidupan bermoral dan berakhlak dalam Islam.",
