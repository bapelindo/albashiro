Her books, including \"13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do,\" have been translated into more than 40 languages. Her TEDx talk,  \"The Secret of Becoming Mentally Strong,\" is one of the most viewed talks of all time. You may have thought about seeing a therapist at one point or another. Perhaps you talked yourself out of it or convinced yourself that if you just wait a little while longer, the problem might go away. Or maybe you’re still questioning if you should talk to someone but aren’t sure it’s a priority for you right now. Knowing when to see a therapist can be a little challenging sometimes. After all, everyone has a bad day or goes through a rough patch every now and again. But how do you know when talking to someone might help? The following list outlines some of the reasons you may benefit from speaking to a therapist. Of course, these are not the only reasons to seek out a therapist, but this list can help you make your decision. We've tried, tested, and written unbiased reviews of the best online therapy programs including Talkspace, BetterHelp, and ReGain. Find out which option is the best for you. With all of life's challenges you may be having trouble balancing your long list of responsibilities. You might be stressed and have difficulty managing and processing all of your feelings. And, it's possible you're not dealing with them in the most effective ways. This is where a therapist comes in. A therapist can help you navigate your feelings and provide you with tools to manage them. Life is inherently stressful. You can’t get rid of all the stress in your life. In fact, some stress is good for you. But, if you’re having trouble managing your stress, you may want to talk to someone. Being stressed out can lead to a variety of issues, like being irritable and short-tempered or becoming inefficient and frantic. A therapist can help you learn healthy stress management skills or they may assist you in problem-solving so you can eliminate some stressful aspects of your life. Uncomfortable emotions, like anxiety and anger, can be tough to manage sometimes. And while you might have some emotions handled well, there may be one or two that seem to get the best of you more frequently. A therapist can help you discover, for example, the specific anger management techniques that work for you, or they could help you practice anxiety reduction strategies that help you feel better faster. No matter what emotions you’re struggling with, a therapist can help you develop a plan to ensure your emotions serve you well. Whether you’re overeating because you’re stressed out or you’re drinking to help you unwind, unhealthy coping skills will introduce new problems into your life—and they backfire in the long-term. Keep in mind that almost any coping skill can be unhealthy. Watching TV, playing video games, or even reading books can become unhealthy if you use them to avoid solving problems. A therapist can help you find healthy coping skills that reduce the intensity of uncomfortable emotions while also helping you face problems head-on. Whether you want to improve your relationship with yourself or with others, a therapist can help you tackle these goals. From weight loss goals to financial goals, there are lots of things that can stand between you and your success. And if you’re struggling to overcome the obstacles in your way, a therapist may be able to help. Mental health professionals can address a variety of issues, like motivational problems, perfectionism, and self-sabotage—all of which can make reaching a goal nearly impossible. There are many reasons why you might be struggling to manage your relationships. Attachment issues, difficulty being assertive, and the fear of confrontation are just a few. A therapist can help you discover problems that are interfering with relationships and assist you with the s...",
  "summary": "Amy Morin, seorang psikolog dan penulis terkemuka, menjelaskan kapan seseorang perlu mempertimbangkan untuk berkonsultasi dengan terapis. Meskipun setiap orang mengalami hari yang sulit, tidak berarti bahwa masalah emosional harus ditangani sendiri. Jika seseorang merasa terbebani oleh stres, kesulitan mengelola perasaan, atau mengalami perubahan emosional yang berkepanjangan, konsultasi dengan terapis bisa menjadi langkah yang bijak. Terapis tidak hanya membantu mengelola stres, tetapi juga memberikan alat dan strategi untuk menghadapi perasaan negatif seperti iritasi, kecemasan, atau ketidakmampuan bekerja secara efektif. Stres yang berlebihan, meskipun alami, bisa mengganggu keseharian dan kesehatan mental. Dengan bantuan terapis, seseorang bisa memahami pola pikirnya, mengenali perasaan yang muncul, dan belajar cara mengelolanya secara sehat. Terapis juga membantu dalam mengatasi masalah seperti kecemasan, depresi, atau kesulitan dalam hubungan. Namun, penting untuk diingat bahwa tidak semua masalah memerlukan intervensi profesional. Kebanyakan orang bisa mengatasi masalah kecil dengan dukungan diri dan perbaikan diri. Namun, jika perasaan tidak membaik, mengganggu kehidupan sehari-hari, atau memengaruhi fungsi mental, maka mencari bantuan profesional menjadi langkah yang tepat. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, seperti tazkiyatun nufus, penting untuk memperhatikan keseimbangan antara kekuatan batin dan kebutuhan akan bantuan, karena kesehatan mental adalah bagian dari kesejahteraan spiritual dan fisik.",
