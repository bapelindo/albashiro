  "content": "Depression can happen to any of us as we age, but there are ways to boost how you feel and make your senior years healthy and happy. Have you lost interest in the activities you used to enjoy? Do you struggle with feelings of helplessness and hopelessness? Are you finding it harder and harder to get through the day? If so, you’re not alone. Depression can happen to any of us as we age, regardless of our background or achievements. And the symptoms of elderly depression can affect every aspect of your life, impacting your energy, appetite, sleep, and interest in work, hobbies, and relationships. Unfortunately, all too many depressed older adults fail to recognize the symptoms of depression, or don’t take the steps to get the help they need. There are many reasons why elderly depression is so often overlooked: It’s important to realize that depression isn’t an inevitable part of getting older—nor is it a sign of weakness or a character flaw. It can happen to anyone, at any age, no matter your background or your previous accomplishments in life. While life’s changes as you age—such as retirement, the death of loved ones, declining health—can sometimes trigger depression, they don’t have to keep you down. No matter what challenges you face as you age, there are steps you can take to feel happy and hopeful once again and enjoy your golden years. Recognizing depression in the elderly starts with knowing the signs and symptoms. Depression red flags include: While depression and sadness might seem to go hand and hand, many depressed seniors claim not to feel sad at all. They may complain, instead, of low motivation, a lack of energy, or physical problems. In fact, physical complaints, such as arthritis pain or worsening headaches, are often the predominant symptom of depression in the elderly. As we age, we experience many losses. Loss is painful—whether it’s a loss of independence, mobility, health, your long-time career, or someone you love. Grieving over these losses is normal and healthy, even if the feelings of sadness last for a long time. Distinguishing between grief and clinical depression isn’t always easy, since they share many symptoms. However, there are ways to tell the difference. As we grow older, we often face significant life changes that can increase the risk for depression. These can include: Health problems. Illness and disability, chronic or severe pain, cognitive decline, damage to your body image due to surgery or sickness can all be contributors to depression. Loneliness and isolation. Factors such as living alone, a dwindling social circle due to deaths or relocation, decreased mobility due to illness or a loss of driving privileges can trigger depression. Reduced sense of purpose. Retirement can bring with it a loss of identity, status, self-confidence, and financial security and increase the risk of depression. Physical limitations on activities you used to enjoy can also impact your sense of purpose. Fears. These include a fear of death or dying as well as anxiety over financial problems, health issues, or abuse or neglect. Recent bereavements. The death of friends, family members, and pets, or the loss of a spouse or partner are common causes of depression in older adults. It’s important to be aware that medical problems can cause depression in older adults and the elderly, either directly or as a psychological reaction to the illness. Any chronic medical condition, particularly if it is painful, disabling, or life-threatening, can lead to depression or make your depression symptoms worse. Symptoms of depression can also occur as a side effect of many commonly prescribed drugs. You’re particularly at risk if you’re taking multiple medications. While the mood-related side effects of prescription medication can affect anyone, older adults are more sensitive because, as we age, our bodies become less efficient at metabolizing and processing drugs. If you feel depr...",
  "summary": "Depresi dapat terjadi pada semua orang, termasuk lansia, meskipun usia bertambah. Gejala depresi pada lansia tidak selalu berupa perasaan sedih, melainkan bisa berupa kehilangan motivasi, kelelahan fisik, penurunan nafsu makan, dan masalah tidur. Banyak lansia mengalami keluhan fisik seperti nyeri sendi atau sakit kepala, yang sebenarnya merupakan tanda depresi. Perubahan dalam kehidupan seperti pensiun, kematian orang tercinta, atau penurunan kesehatan bisa memicu depresi, namun hal ini tidak berarti bahwa depresi adalah bagian alami dari usia atau tanda kelemahan. Depresi bisa diatasi dengan langkah-langkah yang tepat. Penting untuk mengenali gejala dan mencari bantuan sejak dini. Lansia sering mengalami kehilangan—dari kemandirian hingga hubungan sosial—yang memicu perasaan hilang harapan. Dalam psikologi Islam, konsep *tazkiyatun nufus* (perbaikan jiwa) dan ketaatan kepada Allah dapat membantu mengatasi perasaan ini dengan memperkuat kepercayaan diri dan harapan. Dengan menjaga kehidupan yang bermakna, menjalani ibadah, dan mempertahankan hubungan sosial, lansia dapat memperbaiki suasana hati. Dukungan keluarga, perawatan medis, dan terapi psikologis juga sangat penting. Kuncinya adalah kesadaran akan gejala depresi dan keberanian untuk mencari bantuan. Lansia tidak harus menerima depresi sebagai bagian dari usia. Dengan pendekatan yang tepat, mereka bisa tetap sehat secara fisik dan mental, menikmati masa tua dengan harapan, kebahagiaan, dan ketenangan.",
