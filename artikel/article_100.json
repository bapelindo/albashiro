Adah Chung is a fact checker, writer, researcher, and occupational therapist. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (now in its fifth edition text revision, known as DSM-5-TR ) is the handbook clinicians and psychiatrists use to diagnose psychiatric disorders. Published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the DSM-5 covers all categories of mental health disorders for both adults and children. It contains descriptions, symptoms, and other criteria for diagnosing mental health disorders. It also contains statistics such as a condition's typical age of onset, the development and course of the disorder, risks and prognostic factors, and other related diagnostic issues. Some government agencies and many insurance carriers require a specific diagnosis to approve payment for support or treatment of mental health conditions. Mental health professionals use the DSM-5 to classify patients for billing purposes. This article discusses the history of the DSM-5 and how the most recent edition compares to past editions. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual was first published in 1952. Since then, there have been several updates issued. In the DSM-I, there were 102 categories of diagnoses, increasing to 182 in the DSM-II, 265 in the DSM-III, and 297 in the DSM-IV. A major issue with the DSM has been validity. In response to this, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) launched the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project to transform diagnosis by incorporating genetics, imaging, cognitive science, and other levels of information to lay the foundation for a new classification system they feel will be more biologically based. In 2013, then-NIMH director Thomas Insel and APA president-elect Jeffrey Lieberman issued a joint statement saying that the DSM-5 represents \"the best information currently available for clinical diagnosis of mental disorders.\" They went on to say that both the DSM-5 and RDoC represent \"complementary, not competing, frameworks\" for the classification and treatment of mental disorders. The National Institute on Mental Health also notes that the RDoC is not meant to be a diagnostic tool and should not be used to replace other diagnostic systems (such as the DSM). Instead, its goal is to serve as a framework for research on mental disorders in order to better understand mental health. The DSM has gone through many changes since it was first published in the early 1950s. The DSM-III introduced a multiaxial or multidimensional approach for diagnosing mental disorders. The multiaxial approach was intended to help clinicians and psychiatrists make comprehensive evaluations of a client's level of functioning because mental illnesses often impact many different life areas. It described disorders using five DSM \"axes\" or dimensions to ensure that all factors—psychological, biological, and environmental—were considered when making a mental health diagnosis. Axis I consisted of mental health and substance use disorders that cause significant impairment. Disorders were grouped into different categories such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders. Axis II was reserved for what we now call intellectual development disorders (intellectual disability) and personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. Personality disorders cause significant problems in how a person relates to the world, while intellectual development disorders are characterized by intellectual impairment and deficits in other areas such as self-care and interpersonal skills.

  "summary": "Manual Diagnostik dan Statistik Gangguan Mental (DSM-5-TR) adalah panduan yang digunakan oleh ahli kesehatan mental, seperti psikiater dan psikolog, untuk mendiagnosis gangguan psikologis. Diterbitkan oleh American Psychiatric Association (APA), DSM-5-TR mencakup kategori gangguan mental bagi orang dewasa dan anak-anak, dengan deskripsi gejala, kriteria diagnosis, serta data statistik seperti usia awal munculnya gangguan, risiko, dan perkembangan penyakit. Banyak lembaga pemerintah dan perusahaan asuransi memerlukan diagnosis spesifik untuk menyetujui pembayaran terkait perawatan mental. Selain itu, DSM-5-TR juga digunakan untuk klasifikasi pasien dalam hal billing. DSM pertama kali diterbitkan pada tahun 1952, dengan jumlah kategori diagnosis meningkat dari 102 (DSM-I) menjadi 297 (DSM-IV). Salah satu kekhawatiran terhadap DSM adalah validitas diagnosis, yang mendorong penelitian baru seperti Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) oleh National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC bertujuan untuk mengganti sistem klasifikasi tradisional dengan pendekatan berbasis genetika, imajinasi, dan ilmu kognitif, agar lebih akurat dan berbasis bukti ilmiah. Meskipun DSM-5-TR tetap menjadi standar di bidang psikiatri, perdebatan terus berlangsung mengenai keakuratan dan keterkaitan antara diagnosis dan kenyataan klinis. Dalam konteks Islam, pemahaman tentang kesehatan mental juga bisa dilihat melalui prinsip tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan jiwa—yang menekankan keseimbangan antara fisik, rohani, dan spiritual.",
