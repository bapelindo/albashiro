  "content": "Posted December 31, 2025 | Reviewed by Monica Vilhauer Ph.D. Much of what we know about the psychological impact of a D\u0026C (a dilation and curettage procedure to remove tissue from the inside of the uterus) comes from research that tracks symptoms—depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress—after pregnancy loss (Lok \u0026 Neugebauer, 2007; Farren et al., 2016). These findings matter. They confirm that this experience can be emotionally destabilizing. What is far less often named is the experience itself—how a D\u0026C can quietly change a person’s relationship to their body, how it can disrupt a basic sense of safety, and how a loss that is handled medically can still feel psychologically unfinished (Kersting \u0026 Wagner, 2012). Because these internal shifts are rarely talked about ahead of time, many people are reassured that everything went as expected, while they feel, at the same time, altered in ways they cannot quite articulate. This gap—between what is medically resolved and what is psychologically lived—has been noted by researchers examining women’s experiences of pregnancy loss (Al-Mutawtah et al., 2023). For many people, the story of having a baby becomes a long and effortful journey, marked by cycles of hope, loss, and recalibration. As fertility treatment progresses, personal boundaries often have to shift. Tests and invasive procedures become routine. The body is examined and managed. Probably one of the most intrusive experiences along the fertility journey—sometimes more than once—is a dilation and curettage. Although often described as a routine medical procedure, a D\u0026C is intensely psychologically disruptive, not because it is rare, but because of what it asks a person to absorb mentally and physically, all at once. A D\u0026C may be recommended for several reasons during fertility treatment or pregnancy. From a medical perspective, the rationale is often clear-cut: the body needs help, waiting may pose a risk, and a timely intervention is required. However, medical clarity does not always go hand in hand with psychological clarity. As one patient put it, “I understand logically why this has to happen—but why does it still feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me?” One of the most painful aspects is how suddenly a D\u0026C can end a story that was still unfolding. Think of a car in full motion that slams into an unexpected wall. There is no time to brake or slow down. Momentum is interrupted instantly. The body absorbs the impact before the mind can fully register it. Shock comes first, not grief. But shock is rarely allowed to fully form, because almost immediately the focus shifts to what needs to be done next. There is often pressure, both internally and externally, to be practical. To decide. To proceed. To get through it. And while the intervention can sometimes bring relief, it can also be a complicated form of relief. Even when the reasons make sense, being told that a D\u0026C is needed often confines shock and grief to a scheduled loss. Something deeply personal becomes managed, reinforcing the sense of disorientation. And when emotional processing is forced to wait behind logistics, it often reemerges later as numbness, emotional flooding, irritability, or a sense of surrealism. There is often nothing outward to reflect the internal psychological and emotional process that has taken place. Sometimes it just feels like time splits into before and after. What follows is often not a clean emotional shift, but a period of disorientation and re-wounding. If a woman entered fertility treatment already carrying feelings of being broken, failed, or defective, those beliefs may surface now with even greater force ( Caputo et al., 2022; Langher et all, 2019). Such deep wounding, when it resurfaces, can feel like another form of internal scraping—psychological rather than physical. This re...",
  "summary": "Proses D\u0026C (dilatasi dan kurettage) merupakan intervensi medis yang bertujuan mengangkat jaringan dari rahim, sering dilakukan dalam perawatan kehamilan atau terapi kesuburan. Meskipun secara medis dianggap sebagai prosedur rutin, pengalaman psikologisnya justru sangat mengganggu. Penelitian menunjukkan bahwa D\u0026C dapat memicu gejala depresi, kecemasan, dan stres pasca-trauma, terutama setelah kehilangan kehamilan. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa pengalaman ini tidak hanya fisik, tetapi juga memengaruhi hubungan seseorang dengan tubuhnya secara mendalam. D\u0026C dapat mengganggu rasa aman dan keseimbangan psikologis, terutama karena proses ini menuntut penyerapan secara mental dan fisik sekaligus. Banyak orang merasa perubahan dalam hubungan dengan tubuh mereka, namun tidak dapat dijelaskan secara jelas. Perbedaan antara penanganan medis yang \"selesai\" dan pengalaman psikologis yang \"belum selesai\" menjadi penting. Dalam perjalanan kesuburan, tubuh menjadi objek yang dipantau dan dikontrol, dan D\u0026C sebagai proses invasif memperkuat kekhawatiran dan ketidakpastian. Penelitian menekankan bahwa pengalaman ini sering kali tidak dibicarakan secara terbuka, sehingga banyak orang merasa terpaku pada persepsi bahwa \"semuanya berjalan normal\", padahal mereka merasakan perubahan batin yang tidak terlihat. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, hal ini menegaskan pentingnya tazkiyatun nufus—perbaikan jiwa—dalam menghadapi peristiwa yang menimbulkan trauma, dengan memperkuat kepercayaan diri, kepercayaan terhadap Allah, dan keseimbangan emosional.",
