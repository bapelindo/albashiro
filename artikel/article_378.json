Nancy has a lifetime of experience with depression, experiencing firsthand how devastating this illness can be. Daniel B. Block, MD, is an award-winning, board-certified psychiatrist who operates a private practice in Pennsylvania. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a mood disorder that is characterized by symptoms that occur at the same time each year, usually during the darker, shorter days of fall and winter. While this condition usually resolves within a few months, it can have a serious impact on how a person feels and functions. It is not uncommon for people to experience seasonal fluctuation in moods. You may have noticed how a gray, rainy day makes you feel gloomy and tired, while a sunny day can leave you feeling cheerful and energized. The longer, sunnier days of summer are often associated with better moods, while the shorter, darker days that begin in late fall often align with an increase in SAD symptoms. The symptoms of SAD occur cyclically with a return of symptoms each year during the winter months. Symptoms can include: Seasonal affective disorder is believed to be caused by a disturbance in the normal circadian rhythm of the body. Sunlight entering through the eyes influences this rhythm. When it's dark, the pineal gland produces a substance called melatonin which is responsible for the drowsiness we feel each day after dusk. Light entering the eyes at dawn shuts off the production of melatonin. Insufficient exposure to sunlight has been associated with low levels of melatonin and serotonin, carbohydrate craving, weight gain, and sleep disturbance. During the shorter days of winter, when people may rise before dawn or not leave their offices until after sunset, these normal rhythms may become disrupted, producing the symptoms of SAD. There is also evidence linking SAD to a reduced amount of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Serotonin is the feel-good substance that is increased by antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). There is no laboratory test for SAD. It is diagnosed based upon a person's symptom history using criteria set forth by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The DSM-5 does not consider SAD to be a separate disorder. Instead, it is a “specifier” of a major depressive episode diagnosis. In order to be diagnosed with SAD a person must, first of all, meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. At least five of the symptoms listed below must be present most of the time during a two-week period. Further, at least one of the person's symptoms must be one of the first two items listed. A depressed mood that is due to a medical condition or that is related to the content of a delusion or hallucination that the person is experiencing would not count. If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. Any symptoms that could be better explained by their connection to a medical condition, substance use, or grief would not count toward a depression diagnosis. In addition, a psychotic disorder, such as schizoaffective disorder, would have to be ruled out as a cause for the symptoms. If these criteria fit, the following criteria would also need to be met to obtain a seasonal pattern specifier: Seasonal affective therapy responds well to treatment. The most commonly used treatments for SAD include light therapy, medication, and psychotherapy. Light therapy using a device that gives off bright, white light is considered the best form of treatment for SAD at this time. In fall 1998, a group of 13 Canadian specialists issued a set of professional consensus guidelines for the treatment of SAD. A...",
  "summary": "Disorder musiman (Seasonal Affective Disorder atau SAD) adalah gangguan suasana hati yang muncul secara berkala setiap tahun, terutama pada musim gugur dan dingin karena hari yang pendek dan gelap. Gejala ini mencakup perasaan sedih, lelah, keinginan makan manis, peningkatan berat badan, dan gangguan tidur. Penyebab utamanya dikaitkan dengan gangguan ritme sirkadian—pola perubahan waktu tubuh yang dipengaruhi cahaya matahari. Ketika cahaya matahari kurang, kelenjar pineal menghasilkan melatonin yang meningkatkan rasa lelah, dan produksi serotonin (zat kimia yang memengaruhi suasana hati) turun. Hal ini menyebabkan perubahan mood dan gangguan fungsi sehari-hari. SAD sering muncul saat hari panjang dan terang di musim panas, namun memburuk saat hari pendek dan gelap di musim dingin. Meskipun gejala ini berlangsung secara siklus dan biasanya membaik setelah musim panas, dampaknya tetap signifikan terhadap kesehatan mental dan kualitas hidup. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, kondisi ini dapat dipahami melalui prinsip tazkiyatun nufus (perbaikan jiwa), di mana individu diminta untuk memperkuat keimanan, beribadah, dan menjaga keseimbangan emosi. Dengan memperhatikan kebiasaan, menjaga rutinitas ibadah, dan menghindari kecemasan, seseorang dapat mengatasi gejala SAD. Terapi cahaya, terapi psikologis, dan perubahan pola tidur juga dapat membantu memperbaiki ritme tubuh dan suasana hati. Penting untuk memahami bahwa SAD bukan kelemahan, melainkan kondisi medis yang memerlukan perhatian dan pengobatan yang tepat.",
