  "content": "What can we do about very young children who cry all the time, or who withdraw, or who resist the very thing they need most: loving care? What can we do about parents who seem lost in the hurts of their own early childhood, and who behave in ways absolutely antithetical to their own stated parenting principles? This is the world of infant mental health, and this book gathers together 25 stories from the author’s 41 years of experience in this remarkable clinical specialty. It will serve as a casebook and guide for infant mental health practitioners, and for the specialized faculty who prepare them. The clarity and accessibility of the cases will, however, make this book compelling to anyone mystified by how our earliest attachment experiences support or confound our later development. Michael Trout completed his specialized training at the Child Development Project at the University of Michigan School of Medicine, under Professor Selma Fraiberg. He has served as the Vice-President for the United States at the World Association for Infant Mental Health, and as a Charter Editorial Board Member for the Infant Mental Health Journal. In addition to publishing four books, seven book chapters and 13 journal articles, he has produced 16 documentary films in the field that are in use in universities and clinics around the world. He won the Selma Fraiberg Award for “…significant contributions to the needs of infants and their families,” and a Lifetime Achievement Award “for his decades of work with children of loss and trauma” from ATTACh. Synthesizing decades of research, this book explores innovations in teaching to enrich the lives of children. It offers practical strategies for educators and parents based on whole child development, creativity, and the power of play. Essential reading. This essential guide to the youth transgender crisis argues social contagion is a key factor in the upsurge. It exposes the perils of medicalization—from puberty blockers to hormones—and offers a vital psychotherapeutic path for families. This book explores the effects of media, from video games and social media to fake news and screen addiction. It emphasizes the need for a healthy media diet and media literacy for all, providing empirically based approaches and sample lesson plans. This book offers a multi-cultural, global perspective on parenting. It combines cultural wisdom with the latest scientific research to guide you in raising a healthy child through every stage, from connecting with an infant to communicating with an adolescent. Based on positive psychological research covering the whole lifespan, this volume critically discusses positive education and work and their connection to life-long flourishing. It will appeal to educators, researchers, and anyone interested in the foundations of well-being. While smart, many students with learning disabilities don’t know how to learn. This book examines evaluation procedures and intervention programs that recognize student strengths and address their needs, providing guidance for educators and building their capacity to help. A positive school climate is central to student success. The Psychology of School Climate is the most comprehensive study on the topic, an essential compendium of global research. This book offers the gateway to understanding the vital bond between students and school climate. Are thinking styles distinct from personality? Can they be changed? Are some styles better than others? This book answers these controversial questions, providing solid research evidence and intriguing insights into the nature of thinking styles for academics and students alike. Explore the fragile world of premature babies, their families, and caregivers. Written by an international team of experts, this book blends cutting-edge research with practical strategies, offering an accessible resource for students, educators, and professionals.",
  "summary": "Buku *Four Decades in Infant Mental Health* menggambarkan pengalaman 41 tahun penulis, Michael Trout, dalam bidang kesehatan mental anak usia dini. Buku ini mengumpulkan 25 kasus nyata yang menunjukkan bagaimana pengalaman ikatan awal pada anak memengaruhi perkembangan mereka di masa depan. Buku ini menjadi panduan praktis bagi profesional kesehatan mental anak, serta bagi pendidik dan orang tua yang mencari solusi untuk anak-anak yang sering menangis, menarik diri, atau menolak perhatian kasih sayang. Penulis, yang pernah melatih di Proyek Pengembangan Anak di Universitas Michigan, menekankan pentingnya pendekatan holistik berbasis permainan, kreativitas, dan perkembangan anak secara keseluruhan. Buku ini membahas bagaimana trauma dan pengalaman masa kecil memengaruhi perilaku dan hubungan orang tua terhadap anak. Penulis juga menyoroti bagaimana orang tua yang mengalami cedera masa kecil bisa berperilaku bertentangan dengan prinsip parenting yang mereka yakini. Dengan gaya yang jelas dan mudah dipahami, buku ini memberikan strategi praktis bagi para pendidik dan orang tua untuk memperbaiki hubungan emosional dan memperkuat ikatan kasih sayang. Buku ini menjadi referensi penting bagi para profesional dan orang tua yang ingin memahami bagaimana pengalaman awal membentuk kehidupan anak. Dalam konteks Islam, hal ini juga menekankan pentingnya tazkiyatun nufus (pengembangan akhlak dan kebaikan batin) dalam membangun hubungan emosional yang sehat dan kuat.",
