  "content": "Kendra Cherry, MS, is a psychosocial rehabilitation specialist, psychology educator, and author of the \"Everything Psychology Book.\" Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. What exactly is a mental disorder? How are these conditions diagnosed? Defining exactly what constitutes a psychological disorder can be tricky, and definitions have changed over time. The first problem is that a mental health professional must first decide exactly how to define \"disorder.\" How do you determine if there is something psychologically wrong or unhealthy about a person? How do you decide what's normal and what's abnormal? If you were to define \"disorder\" as something that lies outside of the statistical norm, then people who are considered exceptionally talented or gifted in a particular area would be regarded as abnormal. So rather than focus on actions that are considered outside of the \"normal,\" statistically speaking, psychologists tend to concentrate on the results of those behaviors. Behaviors that are considered maladaptive and cause significant personal distress and interrupt daily functioning are more likely to be labeled as disorders. Today, many mental health professionals agree that mental disorders are characterized by both personal distress and impairment in multiple areas of life. This article discusses how clinicians define and classify mental disorders. It also explores how many people are impacted by such disorders every year. A mental disorder is often used interchangeably with the terms psychological disorder, psychiatric disorder, or mental illness. The “official” term is mental disorder, defined in the latest edition of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual, the DSM-5 (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). The DSM-5 defines a mental disorder as a syndrome that causes significant disturbance in behavior, emotion, and cognition. These disorders are also usually accompanied by significant distress that affects a person's work, school, and social relationships. The DSM-5 also notes that expected responses to a common stressor, such as the death of a loved one, are not considered mental disorders (unless the negative effects of that stressor last an inordinately long amount of time). The diagnostic manual also suggests that behaviors that are often considered at odds with social norms are not considered disorders unless these actions are the result of some dysfunction. Mental disorders are defined as conditions that create distress and affect a person's ability to function. These conditions affect how people behave, think, and feel. They can also impact how people are able to function at home, at work, in school, in relationships, and in other important life domains. The specific symptoms a person might experience depend on the nature of the mental health condition they are experiencing. Some of the symptoms that a person with a mental disorder might experience include: If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. The classification and diagnosis of mental disorders are important concerns for both mental health providers and mental health clients. While there is no single, definitive definition of mental disorders, some different classifications and diagnostic criteria have emerged. Clinicians utilize the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association, to determine whether a set of symptoms or behaviors meets the criteria for diagnosis as a mental disorder. The International Classification of Diseases, published by the World Health Organization, is also frequently used. Mental disorders c...",
  "summary": "Mental disorder adalah kondisi yang menyebabkan gangguan signifikan dalam perilaku, emosi, dan kognisi, yang mengganggu fungsi sehari-hari dan menyebabkan rasa kecemasan atau ketidaknyamanan pribadi. Klasifikasi mental disorder biasanya dilakukan oleh profesional kesehatan mental, seperti psikolog dan psikiater, dengan merujuk pada kriteria dari DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). Definisi \"disorder\" tidak hanya berdasarkan nilai statistik normal, tetapi lebih fokus pada perilaku yang maladaptif dan menyebabkan ketidakmampuan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Kondisi seperti ini dianggap sebagai gangguan jika mereka mengganggu fungsi sosial, profesional, atau emosional. Kondisi mental ini sering disebut sebagai gangguan psikologis, gangguan psikiatri, atau gangguan mental. Dalam praktiknya, profesional kesehatan mental menilai apakah perilaku seseorang menyebabkan rasa sakit, gangguan fungsi, atau gangguan dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Karena itu, seseorang yang sangat berbakat dalam bidang tertentu tidak dianggap mengalami gangguan, meskipun hasilnya berada di luar nilai rata-rata. Kini, banyak ahli kesehatan mental sepakat bahwa gangguan mental ditandai oleh kecemasan pribadi dan gangguan pada berbagai aspek kehidupan. Kondisi ini memerlukan intervensi yang tepat, baik secara psikologis maupun medis. Dalam konteks Islam, pemahaman tentang gangguan mental juga dapat dilihat melalui perspektif tazkiyatun nufus, yaitu perbaikan jiwa dan keseimbangan emosional, yang mendukung kesehatan mental secara holistik. Dengan memahami definisi dan klasifikasi gangguan mental, masyarakat dapat lebih memahami dan memberikan dukungan yang tepat kepada mereka yang mengalami kesulitan.",
