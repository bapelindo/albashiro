Her books, including \"13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do,\" have been translated into more than 40 languages. Her TEDx talk,  \"The Secret of Becoming Mentally Strong,\" is one of the most viewed talks of all time. Steven Gans, MD is board-certified in psychiatry and is an active supervisor, teacher, and mentor at Massachusetts General Hospital. There isn’t a single test that can determine if you have a mental illness—or deem you 100% mentally healthy. Instead, a diagnosis of mental illness is made by a medical or mental health professional who has conducted a thorough evaluation. There are a number of reasons why you might need to be screened for a mental health condition. Some of these reasons include: Thoughts of self-harm or suicide are one of the most serious signs of a mental health condition. If you are having suicidal thoughts, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger, call 911. For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database. If you are concerned about the mental health symptoms you are experiencing, the first step is to talk to your doctor for a mental health assessment. This assessment often involves a number of things including a physical exam, lab tests, questionnaires, and interviews. In most cases, a primary care physician (PCP) or family doctor will rule out physical health issues first. Some medical conditions can contribute to or mimic mental health problems, so lab tests or a complete physical exam may be necessary. Hypothyroidism, for example, may mimic symptoms of depression. When this is the case, treating the thyroid condition may help someone feel better emotionally. Your doctor may also ask you questions about your personal history. This will include different aspects of your life, including your marital status, family and social relationships, occupation, and sources of stress. This information can give your doctor a better idea of the supports and stressors you have in your life that might be contributing to how you are feeling. Your doctor may also conduct a mental health evaluation. This will involve asking questions about your feelings, behaviors, and thoughts. You will be asked to describe the symptoms you have been experiencing, including when these symptoms occur, how often you have been having them, and to what degree they impact your life. As part of this screening, you may also be asked to fill out different questionnaires that are meant to measure symptoms of conditions like depression and anxiety. Once physical health issues are ruled out, a PCP may make a diagnosis of mental illness. PCPs are qualified to diagnose mental illnesses, like major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Sometimes, they prescribe medication to treat mental illness. Quite often, however, primary care physicians refer patients with a suspected mental illness to a mental health professional. Just like seeing a cardiologist if you are having heart problems, seeing a mental health professional if you are having mental health problems is always better than working with a general practitioner. A PCP may recommend that you see a psychiatrist for medication management or give you a referral to a psychotherapist for talk therapy. Before starting treatment, the mental health professional who is making a diagnosis will interview you. Questions often focus on your current symptoms, your history of symptoms, and difficulties with day-to-day functioning. Family members may be interviewed as well. This is especially true when a child is being diagnosed with a mental illness or when an individual has poor insight or is an unreliable reporter (if they have trouble describing what is happening to them or cannot provide an accurate description of how serious their symptoms are).

  "summary": "Tidak ada tes tunggal yang dapat menentukan apakah seseorang mengalami gangguan mental atau benar-benar sehat secara mental. Diagnosis gangguan mental harus dilakukan oleh profesional kesehatan mental, seperti psikiater atau psikolog, melalui evaluasi menyeluruh. Faktor yang mungkin memicu pemeriksaan kesehatan mental antara lain kecenderungan berpikir mengenai self-harm atau bunuh diri. Jika mengalami hal tersebut, segera hubungi layanan bantuan darurat seperti nomor 988 atau 911 jika ada ancaman nyata. Langkah pertama jika merasa cemas terkait gejala kesehatan mental adalah berbicara dengan dokter, terutama dokter keluarga atau dokter primer. Evaluasi ini biasanya mencakup pemeriksaan fisik, tes laboratorium, kuesioner, dan wawancara. Dalam banyak kasus, dokter akan memeriksa kondisi fisik terlebih dahulu, karena beberapa penyakit fisik seperti hipotiroidisme dapat meniru gejala depresi atau gangguan emosional. Jadi, penting untuk memahami bahwa gangguan mental tidak selalu terkait dengan masalah psikologis semata. Kombinasi antara faktor fisik dan psikologis harus dipertimbangkan. Dengan demikian, pendekatan kesehatan mental yang komprehensif dan terintegrasi sangat penting. Ini juga mencerminkan prinsip *tazkiyatun nufus* dalam Islam, di mana keseimbangan antara fisik, mental, dan spiritual harus dipertahankan untuk mencapai kestabilan batin dan kesehatan jiwa.",
