Rachel Goldman, PhD FTOS, is a licensed psychologist, clinical assistant professor, speaker, wellness expert specializing in eating behaviors, stress management, and health behavior change. Deciding you’re ready to go to therapy is a huge first step. It is worth taking a moment to honor this decision because it is one that will likely change your life. However, the steps to finding the therapy you need can be rather daunting. In particular, choosing the right kind of therapy for you can be an exhausting battle. There are many different types of therapy, and the kind you need is dependent upon what you’re hoping to heal within yourself. This article will explain how you can choose the best type of therapy for your needs. Choosing the right kind of therapy for yourself is crucial in meeting your therapeutic goals, which gets you to feel better faster. Also, therapy can be very expensive, with a recent Verywell Mind survey stating the average cost per session is $178. Getting clear on the right therapy for you can save you time and money. There are many different reasons why you may be seeking out therapy. Of course, seeking therapy is a good idea if you have been diagnosed with a mental health condition, but that's not a requirement. You could be experiencing interpersonal problems, healing from trauma, trying to get sober, or need extra support for a stressful event in your life. Or, perhaps you’re experiencing all of the above. Regardless, understanding why you’re ready to go to therapy will help you identify what type of therapy you need. Folks often turn to therapy when they’re feeling overwhelmed and burdened by their emotions. Having to decide exactly what you need from the experience can lead to even more distress. It is completely normal to feel stressed and it is OK if you don’t know what kind of therapy you need. Consider writing down the top three things you’d like to work on in therapy. For example, maybe it is the loss of a parent, the stress of beginning a new job, and generally feeling anxious on a daily basis. This would translate into you seeking support for grief, stress, and anxiety. You can then search online for therapists who specialize in any of those areas and book a consultation with them. You might want to use an online therapy directory, which is essentially a virtual phonebook for therapists, if you would like to choose your own provider. During the consultation, you can ask them what kind of therapy they practice and why it would be a good fit for you. Mental health professionals don’t expect clients to be experts and are happy to provide some insight into what they do. Or, you could sign up for an online therapy service, which usually matches you with a therapist based on information you provide when signing up. Many online therapy companies offer a wide range of therapists who specialize in different things, while some offer treatment for specific conditions like anxiety and depression. The latter can be especially helpful if you know for sure that you need treatment for a particular mental health issue. There are many different types of therapy, which can make the process of choosing the right modality even more tiring. Worry not! Below you'll find information about three popular treatment modalities. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a popular structured and goal-oriented talk therapy approach that has proven efficacy in treating many mental health ailments, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, eating disorders, and personality disorders. CBT is a straightforward approach that focuses on identifying and changing one’s negative or unhelpful thoughts, inaccurate perceptions of self and others, and harmful underlying beliefs. It is considered a short-term therapy, with treatment typically lasting between ...",
  "summary": "Memilih jenis terapi yang tepat sangat penting untuk mencapai tujuan terapeutik dan mempercepat perbaikan kondisi mental. Julia Childs Heyl dan Rachel Goldman, ahli psikologi, menekankan bahwa keputusan untuk memperoleh terapi adalah langkah pertama yang berdampak besar dalam perjalanan pemulihan. Namun, memilih jenis terapi yang sesuai bisa terasa menakutkan karena banyak pilihan tersedia. Kebutuhan terapi bervariasi: bisa untuk mengatasi gangguan mental, memulihkan trauma generasi, mengelola stres, menghentikan kecanduan, atau menangani masalah hubungan. Memahami alasan Anda memilih terapi akan membantu menentukan jenis terapi yang paling sesuai. Misalnya, jika Anda mengalami trauma, terapi mendalam seperti depth psychotherapy mungkin lebih efektif. Jika masalahnya berkaitan dengan pola makan atau manajemen stres, pendekatan seperti konseling perilaku atau terapi kesehatan perilaku lebih tepat. Biaya terapi juga cukup tinggi, rata-rata mencapai $178 per sesi, sehingga memilih terapi yang tepat bisa menghemat waktu dan biaya. Penting untuk menghargai keputusan ini dan mengenali bahwa merasa bingung adalah hal normal. Dalam konteks psikologi Islam, pemahaman terhadap kondisi batin dan kebutuhan rohani juga penting—seperti tazkiyatun nufus (pemurnian jiwa) yang mendorong keseimbangan antara akal, perasaan, dan kepercayaan. Dengan mempertimbangkan tujuan, kebutuhan, dan kondisi batin, Anda dapat memilih terapi yang tidak hanya mengatasi gejala, tetapi juga membangun kekuatan batin dan keseimbangan hidup secara holistik.",
